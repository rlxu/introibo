<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Macartney Embassy</strong></h2>
<p>was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain">British</a> mission to China in 1793 led by the first envoy of Great Britain to China, Lord <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Macartney,_1st_Earl_Macartney">George Macartney</a>. The goal of the endeavor was to convince <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Qianlong">Emperor Qianlong</a> to allow Britain to have a permanent embassy in Beijing, and reduced tariffs on traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Oceanic trade between China and Europe had begun in the sixteenth century, and over time included the Portuguese, the Spanish, the British, and the Dutch. To control and tax the foreigners, trade was eventually restricted to the port of Canton. Guidelines restricted formal trade to a handful of &ldquo;Hong&rdquo; (行) merchants selected by the government. As trade intensified, disputes broke out between the British traders and the Hong. By the late 18th century, British traders were feeling confined by the system. They lobbied King George III to send an Embassy to go before the Emperor and request access to more ports and representation at Court. Lord George Macartney was sent for this reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Tribute System</strong></p>
<p>Foreign delegations seeking relations with China were required to present tribute, thereby acknowledging their inferior status, and to perform the kowtow. &nbsp;In return, the Emperor bestowed gifts and titles upon foreign emissaries and allowed them to trade for short periods of time during their stay within China.</p>
<p>Foreign rulers agreed to these terms for several reasons; namely, because the gifts received from the Emperor were of greater value than the tribute given (as a demonstration of imperial munificence) and because the trade conducted while in China was extremely lucrative and exempt from customs duties. &nbsp;This arrangement became increasingly unacceptable to European nations, in particular to Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Since Macartney demanded that Britain be treated as an equal, he refused to kowtow, and the Embassy failed. Qianlong subsequently sent a letter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_III">King George III</a>, explaining in greater depth the reasons for his refusal to grant the several requests presented by Macartney.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Qianlong&rsquo;s Response to George III</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You, O King, live beyond the confines of many seas; nevertheless, impelled by your humble desire to partake of the benefits of our civilization, you have dispatched a mission respectfully bearing your memorial&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>As to your entreaty to send one of your nationals to be accredited to my Celestial Court and to be in control of your country's trade with China, this request is contrary to all usage of my dynasty and cannot possibly be entertained&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lord Macartney's Observations</strong></p>
<p>In George Macartney's memoirs, there were many passages describing what was, in his opinion, an overall poor quality of life for the Chinese under Qing rule:</p>
<p><em>The Empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a fortunate succession of vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these hundred and fifty years past, and to overawe their neighbours merely by her bulk and appearance. But whenever an insufficient man happens to have the command on deck, adieu to the discipline and safety of the ship. She may, perhaps, not sink outright; she may drift some time as a wreck, and will then be dashed to pieces on the shore; but she can never be rebuilt on the old bottom</em>.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Qian Long&rsquo;s Abdication</strong></h2>
<p>In October 1795, Qianlong officially announced that in the spring of the following year he would voluntarily abdicate his throne and pass the crown to his son. It was said that Qianlong had made a promise during the year of his ascension not to rule longer than his grandfather, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor">Kangxi Emperor</a>, who had reigned for 61 years. Under Qianlong the Manchu empire had added Xinjiang and Tibet, while agriculture made great strides and the arts flourished. The decay within China was a result of the explosion of the population from around 100 million in 1700 to around 200 million in 1800.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Jiaqing Emperor</strong><strong> 嘉慶帝 </strong><strong>(ruled 1796 &ndash; 1820)</strong></h2>
<p>was the fifteenth son of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qianlong</a>. During his reign, he attempted to restore the state to financial health and curb the smuggling of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a> into China.</p>
<p><strong>Accession to the throne</strong></p>
<p>The empire faced internal disorder, most importantly the large-scale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Rebellion">White Lotus</a> (1796&ndash;1804) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miao_Rebellion_1795-1806">Miao Rebellions</a> (1795&ndash;1806), as well as an empty treasury. Emperor Jiaqing engaged in the pacification of the empire and quelled the rebellions. He endeavored to bring China back to its 18th-century prosperity and power. However, due in part to large outflows of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver">silver</a> from the country as payment for the opium smuggled into China from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India">British India</a>, the economy declined.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition to Christianity (Catholicism)</strong></p>
<p>Into The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Qing_Code">Great Qing Code</a> "Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses" a clause was added in 1811 refering directly to Christianity, which sentenced Europeans to death for spreading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism">Catholicism</a> among Chinese and Manchus, while unrepentant Chinese Christians were sent as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave">slaves</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Daoguang Emperor</strong><strong> 道光帝 </strong><strong>(ruled 1820 &ndash; 1850)</strong></h2>
<p>was the second son of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor">Jiaqing Emperor</a>. His reign was marked by "external disaster and internal rebellion," that is, by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>, and the beginning of numerous rebellions, which nearly brought down the dynasty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>
<p>Well liked by his grandfather <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qianlong</a>, he frequently accompanied the elderly emperor on hunting trips. On one such trip at the age of nine he killed a deer, much to the delight of Qianlong. Moreover, in 1813, he played a vital role in repelling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus">White Lotus</a> invaders who had stormed the Forbidden City, and this heroic action helped secure his claim to the throne.</p>
<p><strong>Reign as emperor and the opium trade</strong></p>
<p>In 1820, at the age of 38, he inherited a declining empire with Westerners encroaching upon its borders. During his reign, China experienced major problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a>, which was smuggled in by British merchants. Opium had started to trickle into China during the reign of Yongzheng, but was limited to approximately 200 chests annually. This amount increased to 40,000 chests during Daoguang's reign.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Opium Wars</strong> <strong>鴉片戰爭 1839-1860</strong></h2>
<p>divided into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a> from 1839 to 1842 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War">Second Opium War</a> from 1856 to 1860, were the climax of trade disputes and diplomatic relations between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a> under the Manchu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British Empire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Qing attitudes toward trade</strong></p>
<p>The Qing and their predecessors, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty">Ming</a> (after the famous journeys of Zheng He), shared an ambivalent attitude towards overseas trade, and maritime activity in general. Qing anti-business attitudes were further aggravated by traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucian">Confucian</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_occupations#The_shang_.28.E5.95.86.29">disdain</a> for merchants and traders. Qing officials believed that trade incited unrest and disorder, promoted piracy, and threatened China's defences. &nbsp;The Qing instituted a set of rigid regulations regarding trade at Chinese ports, setting up four maritime customs offices (in Canton, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian">Fujian</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang">Zhejiang</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu">Jiangsu</a>) and a 20 percent tariff on all foreign goods. These policies succeeded only in establishing a system of kickbacks and purchased monopolies that enriched the officials who administered coastal regions.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars#cite_note-Spence_57-12"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Opium Trade</strong></p>
<p>Low Chinese demand for European goods, and high European demand for Chinese goods, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea">tea</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk">silk</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain">porcelain</a>, forced European merchants to purchase these goods with silver, the only currency the Chinese would accept. From the mid-17th century a trade surplus was enjoyed by China of around 28&nbsp;million kilograms of silver, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese goods. &nbsp;British traders blamed the restrictions of trade in Canton for their failure to balance their exports with their imports. The British and other Europeans tried to reduce their trade deficit (the great mercantilist sin) by importing tea from India and other places, and Germans managed to reverse engineer the making of porcelain, but the deficit remained.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">Opium</a> was first introduced to China by Turkish and Arab traders, and had been used in China since the 7th century AD for medicinal purposes. It was not until the 17th century, though, that the practice of mixing opium with tobacco for smoking was introduced into China by Europeans. With India and its poppy fields under British control, the obvious way to correct the trade deficit was to start exporting opium to China. The Qing Administration initially tolerated opium importation, because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, while allowing the British to double tea exports from China to England&mdash;which profited the monopoly for tea exports of the Qing imperial treasury and its agents.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War#cite_note-11"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>In 1729, the import of opium into China stood at 200 chests, each holding about 55&nbsp;kg (121 pounds) of opium. In 1810, the Emperor issued a decree banning the trade or consumption of opium, but it had little effect. The Qing government, in Beijing in the north of China, was unable to halt opium smuggling in the southern provinces. By the 1820s China was importing 900 tons (15,000 chests) of Bengali opium annually. &nbsp;The planting of tea in the Indian and African colonies along with accelerated opium consumption reversed the flow of silver, just when the Imperial Treasury needed to finance suppression of rebellions against the Qing. The Qing government attempted to end the opium trade, but its efforts were complicated by local officials, who profited greatly from the bribes and taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 1838 China was importing 40,000 chests annually. With the drain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver">silver</a> and the growing number of people addicted to the drug, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoguang">Daoguang</a> Emperor demanded action. The Emperor sent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Zexu">Lin Zexu</a> as Imperial Commissioner to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, where he quickly arrested Chinese opium dealers and summarily demanded that foreign firms turn over their stocks. When they refused, Lin blockaded the British traders in their factories and cut off supplies of food. &nbsp;On March 27, 1839 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Elliot">Charles Elliot</a>, British Superintendent of Trade&mdash;who had been locked in the factories when he arrived at Canton&mdash;finally agreed that all British subjects should turn over their opium, amounting to nearly a year's supply of the drug, to Lin Zexu. On his own authority, Elliot promised merchants that the Crown would compensate them for the lost opium. This amounted to a tacit acknowledgment that the British government supported the trade. Unable to allocate funds for an illegal drug but pressed for compensation by the merchants, this liability is cited as one reason for the decision to force a war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to seizing supplies in the factories, Chinese troops boarded British ships in international waters outside Chinese jurisdiction, where their cargo was still legal, and destroyed the opium aboard. 20,000 chests &nbsp;were handed over and destroyed beginning 3 June 1839. After the opium was surrendered, trade was restarted on the strict condition that no more drugs be smuggled into China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the collection and destruction of the opium, Lin Zexu wrote an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Communications_of_the_Chinese_Empire#Memorials">official memorial</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> (she supposedly never received it) questioning the moral reasoning of the British government. Citing what he understood to be a strict prohibition of the trade within Great Britain, Lin questioned how Britain could then profit from the drug in China. In fact, opium was not illegal in England at the time. British merchants offered no response to Lin, accusing him of destroying their property.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Kowloon (Carnatic) Incident (July 1839)</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday, 7&nbsp;July 1839, a large group of British and American sailors, including crew from the British clipper ship <em>Carnatic</em>, ashore at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon">Kowloon</a>, a provisioning point, became drunk on <em>samshu</em>, a rice wine. The sailors then vandalised a Buddhist temple and killed a man named Lin Weixi. &nbsp;Because China did not have a jury trial system or evidentiary process (the magistrate was the prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner), the British demanded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality"><em>extraterritoriality</em></a>, the right to have British subjects tried by British judges. Qing authorities demanded that the men be handed over for trial, and further insisted that British merchants not be allowed to trade unless they signed a bond, under penalty of death, promising not to smuggle opium. Citing China&rsquo;s different legal system as the reason for his refusal to hand over any suspects or agree to the bonds, Charles Elliot ordered the British community to withdraw from Canton and prohibited trade with the Chinese. Some merchants who did not deal in opium were willing to sign the bond, thereby weakening the British position. On Captain Elliot&rsquo;s authority, the six sailors were tried by the British authorities in Canton, but were immediately released once they reached England. Tensions continued to increase. Qing officials declared that foreign merchants would not be allowed to trade with China unless they agreed to abide by Chinese law and Chinese legal jurisdiction. Elliot responded by suspending all British trade with China.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The First Opium War </strong><strong>(1839 &ndash; 1842)</strong></h2>
<p>In late October 1839, the <em>Thomas Coutts</em> arrived in Canton. This ship was owned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers">Quakers</a> who refused to deal in opium, and its Captain Smith believed Elliot had exceeded his legal authority by banning trade. The captain negotiated with the governor of Canton, signed the Qing legal bond, and agreed to unload his goods at Chuenpee, an island near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humen_Town">Humen</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent other British ships from following the <em>Thomas Coutts</em>, Elliot ordered a blockade of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_%28China%29">Pearl River</a>, and on November 3 the British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HMS_Volage_%281825%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">HMS <em>Volage</em></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hyacinth_%281829%29">HMS <em>Hyacinth</em></a> fired warning shots at the British trading ship <em>Royal Saxon</em> as it attempted to sail to Canton.</p>
<p>The Qing navy attempted to protect the British merchant vessel, and reported a great victory for that day, though many Chinese ships were sunk by the British Navy in the resulting First Battle of Chuenpee.</p>
<p>In 1840, Elliot asked the Portuguese governor in Macau to let British ships load and unload their goods there in exchange for paying rent and any duties. The governor refused for fear that the Qing Government would discontinue supplying food and other necessities to Macau. On 14 January 1840, the Qing Emperor asked all foreigners in China to halt material assistance to the British in China. In retaliation, the British Government and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company">British East India Company</a> decided that they would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Canton_%28disambiguation%29">attack </a>Canton. The military cost would be paid by the British Government.</p>
<p>The China problem emerged just as Britain faced serious pressures in the Near East, on the Indian frontier, and in Latin America. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, the British Foreign Secretary, supported the Opium War &ldquo;to maintain the principle of free trade, obtain full compensation for the destroyed opium, and uphold Britain&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo; The War was attacked in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom">House of Commons</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who denounced the war as "unjust and iniquitous" and criticised Palmerston's willingness "to protect an infamous contraband traffic." &nbsp;The public and press in the United States and Britain expressed outrage that Britain was supporting the opium trade. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> replied by saying that the war was being fought to remedy Britain's balance of payments deficit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> commented that opium was &ldquo;incidental to the dispute... the cause of the war is the kowtow&mdash;the arrogant and insupportable pretensions of China that she will hold commercial intercourse with the rest of mankind not upon terms of equal reciprocity, but upon the insulting and degrading forms of the relations between lord and vassal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 1840, an expeditionary force reached Canton from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>. The marines were headed by Commodore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bremer">James Bremer</a>, who demanded that the Qing Government compensate the British for losses suffered from interrupted trade. Following the orders of Lord Palmerston, a British expedition blockaded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocca_Tigris">mouth</a> of the Pearl River, moved north and took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoushan">Chusan</a>. The next year, 1841, the British captured the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogue_forts">Bogue forts</a> that guarded the mouth of the Pearl River&mdash;the waterway between Hong Kong and Canton. By January 1841, British forces commanded the high ground around Canton and had defeated the Chinese at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo">Ningbo</a> and at the military post of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghai">Dinghai</a>.</p>
<p>British military superiority drew on newly applied technology. British warships powered by steam were able to move against the winds and tides and support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were the first to be armed with modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket">muskets</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon">cannons</a>, which fired more rapidly and with greater accuracy than the antique Qing firearms and artillery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the middle of 1842, the British had occupied Shanghai, thus controlling the critically important Yangtze River, and seized the tax barges, which transported tax revenue to the imperial court in Beijing. After a long string of humiliating defeats, which tarnished the reputation of Chinese imperial power, the war finally ended in August 1842, with the signing of the first of China's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_Treaties">Unequal Treat</a>ies, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking">Treaty of Nanking</a>. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity totaling 21 million silver dollars to Britain, open four ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria&ldquo;in perpetuity.&rdquo; In the supplementary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Bogue">Treaty of the Bogue</a>, the Qing Empire also recognised Britain as an equal and a &ldquo;most favored nation&rdquo; to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports. In 1844, the United States and France concluded similar treaties with China, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wanghia">Treaty of Wanghia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Whampoa">Treaty of Whampoa</a>, respectively, initiating a century of &ldquo;national humiliations&rdquo; for the Chinese as concessions and new privileges were bestowed on the foreigners.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>The ease with which the British forces defeated the numerically superior Chinese armies seriously affected the Qing Dynasty's prestige. The success of the First Opium War not only allowed the British to resume the opium trade, but also paved the way to open the lucrative Chinese market to other commerce and to open Chinese society to missionary endeavors.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Zexu">Lin Zexu</a>, who had arrested 1,700 opium dealers and destroyed 2.6&nbsp;million pounds of opium, was scapegoated for the military defeat. &nbsp;Nevertheless, Lin Zexu is popularly viewed as a hero of 19th century China, and his likeness has been immortalised at various locations around the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War#cite_note-30"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Daoguang&rsquo;s death and legacy</strong></p>
<p>Daoguang died on 25 February 1850, just as the upheaval of the Taiping Rebellion began to intensify, and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son. Daoguang had understood neither the intentions nor the determination of the Europeans, nor even the basic economics of the war on opium. Although the Europeans were outnumbered, outgunned and thousands of miles from home, they brought far superior firepower to bear wherever they attacked along the Chinese coast.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Taiping Rebellion</strong> <strong>太平天國</strong> <strong>(1850 &ndash; 1864)</strong></h2>
<p>originating in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces of southern China, began in December 1850, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan">Hong Xiuquan</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people">Hakka</a> leader of a syncretic Christian sect, defeated local forces sent to disperse his followers. Hong then proclaimed the establishment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom">Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</a>, after which the rebellion spread to several other provinces with amazing speed.</p>
<p>In 1853 the Taiping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nanjing_%281853%29">captured Nanjing</a> and for a while it seemed that Beijing would fall next. Because the Manchu troops were unsuccessful and ineffective, Xianfeng dispatched several prominent ethnic Chinese mandarins, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan">Zeng Guofan</a>; and other non-Manchu forces, such as the Mongol general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senggelinqin">Sengge Rinchen</a>, to crush the rebellions.</p>
<p>Hong established the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom">Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</a> with its capital at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, whence he controlled large parts of southern China, at one point ruling about 30 million people. The rebel agenda included social reforms such as shared property, equality for women, and the replacement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion">Chinese folk religion</a> with their form of Christianity. Because of their refusal to wear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28hairstyle%29">queue</a>, Taiping troops were termed "Longhairs" by the Qing government. Due to internal disputes, poor organization and ineffective administration, the rebellion began to falter. The government eventually crushed the rebellion with the aid of native Han, Mongol, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_Empire">French</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British</a> forces.</p>
<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
<p>China, under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> in the mid-19th century, suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems and defeats at the hands of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_powers">Western powers</a>; in particular, the humiliating defeat in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>. The Qing government, led by ethnic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu">Manchus</a>, was seen by much of the Han Chinese population as an ineffective and corrupt foreign regime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Manchuism">Anti-Manchu sentiment</a> was strongest in the south among the laboring classes and it was these disaffected elements who flocked to join the charismatic Hong, a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka">Hakka</a> community, itself a disaffected segment of Chinese society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the age of thirty-seven, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan">Hong Xiuquan</a>, had failed in numerous attempts to pass the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examinations">imperial examinations</a> (5% pass rate), and was thus denied access to the ranks of the ruling scholar-elite. Hong then experienced a lengthy illness, from which he recovered with a changed personality. After reading a pamphlet he had received from a Protestant Christian missionary, Hong concluded that his illness was in fact a visionary trance&nbsp; which revealed that he was the younger brother of Jesus, and had been sent to rid China of "devils"; i.e., corrupt Manchu rulers and followers of Confucius. After this vision, he felt it was his duty to spread his interpretation of Christianity and overthrow Manchu rule. American Baptist missionary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issachar_Jacox_Roberts">Issachar Jacox Roberts</a> became a teacher and an adviser to Hong. The sect's power grew in the late 1840s, initially as a campaign to suppress bandits, then as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare">guerrilla rebellion</a>, and finally as a widespread, bloody <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war">civil war</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>
<p>The revolt began in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guangxi</a> province. The Taiping belief in sharing property in common and their propaganda against the Manchu rulers gained followers among peasants, workers, miners, and other outcasts. The Taiping Rebellion aroused the general discontent of the Chinese people with the Manchus, who were deemed corrupt and ineffective against bandits and foreigners. The revolt soon spread throughout southeastern China as peasant bands joined the evangelical movement. By 1853 the group, which had grown to an army of more than a million, controlled five provinces on the lower reaches of the Yangzi.</p>
<p><strong>Middle years</strong></p>
<p>Hong Xiuquan withdrew from active control of policies and administration, ruling exclusively by written proclamations that often had religious content. Hong disagreed with his lieutenant Yang Xiuqing in certain matters of policy and became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions, his extensive network of spies, and Yang&rsquo;s declarations when "speaking as God." Yang, his family, and all those loyal to him were put to death in 1856.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the Chinese middle classes and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts. The Europeans, preferring an effete, pliant government to a strong, revolutionary one, decided to stay neutral. Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of the rebels' hostility to Chinese customs and Confucian values. The land-owning upper class, unsettled by the Taipings' land reform policies and peasant sympathies, sided with government forces and their Western allies.</p>
<p>In 1859 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Rengan">Hong Rengan</a>, a cousin of Hong Xiuquan, developed an ambitious plan to expand the Kingdom's boundaries. In 1860 the Taiping rebels succeeded in taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou">Suzhou</a> to the east, but they eventually became overextended and their failure to take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> marked the beginning of the decline of the Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Fall of the Kingdom</strong></p>
<p>The attempt to take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> in August 1860 was repulsed by a force of Qing imperial troops and European officers under the command of the American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Townsend_Ward">Frederick Townsend Ward</a>, who conceived of training and outfitting local Chinese with Western weapons. This remarkably effective unit was termed the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Victorious_Army">Ever Victorious Army</a>," and was led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon">Charles "Chinese" Gordon</a> after Ward&rsquo;s death in 1862. Imperial forces were reorganized under the command of the ethnic Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan">Zeng Guofan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a>, and the imperial reconquest began in earnest. By early 1864 imperial control in most areas was re-established. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Although the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the demise of the Taiping regime, the struggle was not yet over. There were still several hundred thousand Taiping rebel troops continuing to fight, with more than a quarter-million Taiping rebels in the border regions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian">Fujian</a> alone. It wasn't until August 1871 that the last Taiping rebel army was completely wiped out by the governmental forces in the border region of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan">Hunan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou">Guizhou</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guangxi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Death toll</strong></p>
<p>With no reliable census at the time, estimates are necessarily based on projections, but the most widely cited sources put the total number of deaths during the 15 years of the rebellion at about 20&ndash;30 million civilians and soldiers. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion#cite_note-12"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a>&nbsp;Most of the deaths were attributed to plague and famine. At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Nanking">Third Battle of Nanking</a> in 1864, more than 100,000 were killed in three days.</p>
<p><strong>Total War</strong></p>
<p><em>Extent of Taiping control in 1854 (in red)</em></p>
<p>The Taiping Rebellion was the first instance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war">total war</a> in modern China. Almost every citizen of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was given military training and conscripted into the army to fight against Qing imperial forces.</p>
<p>During this conflict both sides tried to deprive the other of resources to continue the war and it became standard practice to destroy agricultural areas, butcher the population of cities and in general exact a brutal price from captured enemy lands in order to drastically weaken the opposition's war effort. This war was total in the sense that civilians on both sides participated to a significant extent in the war effort and in the sense that armies on both sides waged war on the civilian population as well as military forces.</p>
<p>This resulted in massive civilian death toll with some 600 cities destroyed. Since the rebellion began in the province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guangxi</a>, Imperial forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. &nbsp;Reportedly in the province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, it is written that 1,000,000 were executed. &nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Second Opium War </strong><strong>(1856&ndash;1860)</strong></h2>
<p>pitted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">Brit</a>ain and France against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> of China. Its motive derived from the fact that both Britain and China were unhappy with the Treaty of Nanking (1842).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 1850s saw the rapid growth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">imperialism</a>. Some of the shared goals of the western powers were the expansion of their overseas markets and the establishment of new ports of call. In an effort to expand its privileges in China, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">Britain</a> demanded that the Qing authorities renegotiate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanjing">Treaty of Nanjing</a> of 1842, citing their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_favoured_nation">most favored nation</a> status. The British demands included opening all of China to British merchants, legalising the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_trade">opium trade</a>, exempting foreign imports from internal transit duties, suppression of piracy, regulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie">coolie</a> trade, permitting a British ambassador to reside in Beijing and giving precedence to the English-language version of all treaties. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> Court, reasserting China&rsquo;s power, rejected the demands from Britain and France.</p>
<h3><strong>The </strong><strong><em>Arrow </em></strong><strong>Incident&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Chinese authorities were unwilling to adhere to the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking and had victimized Chinese merchants who traded with the British at the treaty ports. To protect those Chinese merchants who were friendly to them in Hong Kong, the British granted their ships British registration in the hope that the Chinese authorities would not interfere with vessels carrying the British flag.</p>
<p>On 8 October 1856, Qing officials boarded the <em>Arrow</em>, a Chinese-owned ship suspected of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy">piracy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling">smuggling</a>. The <em>Arrow</em> had formerly been registered as a British ship, and still flew the British flag. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of piracy. The British consul in Canton demanded the immediate release of the crew claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was protected under the Treaty of Nanjing, and demanded an apology for the insult to the British flag. British trade officials argued that since the <em>Arrow</em> was a foreign vessel, it did not fall under Chinese legal jurisdiction. In fact, the British registration of the <em>Arrow</em> had expired, in which case she did not have the right to fly the ensign, and her crew's arrest by the Qing authorities was lawful in any case. The crew was released, but an apology was not given. In reprisal, the British governor in Hong Kong, without consulting London, ordered warships to bombard Canton. Still, British Prime Minister Palmerston, claiming to be upholding British prestige and avenging the insult to the flag, supported his actions. Faced with fighting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a>, the Qing government was in no position to resist the West militarily.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>British attacks</strong></h3>
<p>Although the British were delayed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857">Indian Sepoy Rebellion of 1857</a>, they followed up the <em>Arrow</em> Incident of 1856 with an attack on Canton from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_%28China%29">Pearl River</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to Whig objections to renewed war with China, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston#Arrow_controversy_and_the_Second_Opium_War">Lord Palmerston</a> dissolved Parliament and called for new elections. The Chinese issue figured prominently in the British general election of March 1857, which Palmerston won with an increased majority. He now felt able to press British claims more vigorously. Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1857">election</a> and an increased majority for Palmerston, the voices within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_%28British_political_faction%29">Whig faction</a> who were in support of China were hushed, and the new parliament decided to seek redress from China based on the report about the <em>Arrow</em> Incident submitted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith_Parkes">Harry Parkes</a>, British Consul to Canton. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_French_Empire">French Empire</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire">Russian Empire</a> received requests from Britain to form an alliance.</p>
<h3><strong>Intervention by France</strong></h3>
<p>Seething after the execution of a French <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary">missionary</a>, Father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Chapdelaine">Auguste Chapdelaine</a>, by Chinese local authorities in Guangxi province in 1856, France eagerly joined the British action against China. The British army led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bruce,_8th_Earl_of_Elgin">Lord Elgin</a>, and the French army led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Louis_Gros">Gros</a>, attacked and occupied Canton in late 1857. The British-French Alliance maintained control of Canton for nearly four years. Guangdong Governor-general Yeh Mingchen was exiled to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, India, where he starved himself to death. The coalition then cruised north to briefly capture the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taku_Forts">Taku Forts</a> near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Tianjin</a> in May 1858.</p>
<p><strong>Interlude - Treaties of Tientsin</strong></p>
<p>In June 1858, the first part of the war ended with the four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Tientsin">Treaties of Tientsin</a>. The major points of the treaty were: Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. would have the right to establish diplomatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legation">legations</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking">Peking</a>; ten more Chinese ports would be opened for foreign trade, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niuzhuang">Niuzhuang</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsui_District">Tamsui</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hankou_District">Hankou</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing">Nanjing</a>; all foreign vessels including commercial ships would have the right to navigate freely on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River">Yangtze River</a>; foreigners would have the right to travel in the internal regions of China, which had been formerly banned; and China was to pay an indemnity to Britain and France of 8 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tael">taels</a> of silver each.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Treaty of Aigun</strong></h3>
<p>On 28 May 1858, the separate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Aigun">Treaty of Aigun</a> was signed with Russia to revise the Chinese and Russian border as determined by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerchinsk_Treaty">Nerchinsk Treaty</a> in 1689. Russia gained the left bank of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_River">Amur River</a>, pushing the border back from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argun_River_%28Asia%29">Argun River</a>. The treaty gave Russia control over a non-freezing area on the Pacific coast, where Russia founded the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> in 1860. Russia received over 600,000 square kilometers of land from China.</p>
<h3><strong>Anglo-French invasion</strong></h3>
<p>In June 1858, shortly after the Qing Court agreed to the disadvantageous treaties, more hawkish ministers prevailed upon the Xianfeng Emperor to resist encroachment by the West. On 2 June 1858, the Xianfeng Emperor ordered the Mongolian general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengge_Rinchen">Sengge Rinchen</a> to guard the Taku Forts near Tianjin. Sengge Rinchen reinforced the Taku Forts with added artillery. He also brought 4,000 Mongolian cavalry from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chahar_%28province%29">Chahar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suiyuan">Suiyuan</a>.</p>
<p>Because Xianfeng refused to ratify the Treaties of Tianjin and Chinese officials continued to refuse to enact the treaty provision to establish foreign legations in Peking, in June 1859, a British naval force with 2,200 troops and 21 ships, under the command of Admiral Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hope_%28Royal_Navy_officer%29">James Hope</a>, sailed north from Shanghai to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Tianjin</a> with newly appointed Anglo-French envoys for the embassies in Beijing. They sailed to the mouth of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_River">Hai River</a> guarded by the Taku Forts near Tianjin and demanded to continue inland to Beijing. Sengge Rinchen replied that the Anglo-French envoys may land up the coast at Beitang and proceed to Beijing but refused to allow armed troops to accompany them to the Chinese capital. The Anglo-French forces insisted on landing at Taku instead of Beitang and escorting the envoys to Beijing. On the night of 24 June 1859, a small squad of British forces blew up the iron obstacles that the Chinese had placed in the Baihe River. The next day, the British forces sought to force their way up the river, and shelled Taku Fort. They encountered fierce resistance from Sengge Rinchen's positions. After one day&rsquo;s and one night's fighting, more than 400 British were killed, four gunboats were lost and two others severely damaged. The convoy withdrew under the cover of fire from a US naval squadron commanded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commodore_%28United_States_Navy%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Commodore</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Tattnall">Josiah Tattnall</a>, though Tattnall's intervention violated US neutrality in China. For a time, anti-foreign resistance reached a crescendo within the Qing Court. In the summer of 1860, a larger Anglo-French force (11,000 British under General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hope_Grant">James Hope Grant</a>, 6,700 French under General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cousin-Montauban,_Comte_de_Palikao">Cousin-Montauban</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War#cite_note-10"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a>&nbsp;with 173 ships sailed from Hong Kong and captured the port cities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantai">Yantai</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian">Dalian</a> to seal off the Bohai Gulf. On 3 August they carried out a landing near at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beitang,_Tanggu_District">Beitang</a>, some 1.9&nbsp;miles from the Taku Forts, which they captured on 21 August. After taking Tienstin on 23 August, the Anglo-French forces marched inland toward Beijing. The Xianfeng Emperor then dispatched ministers for peace talks, but relations broke down completely when a British diplomatic envoy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith_Parkes">Harry Parkes</a>, was arrested during negotiations on 18 September. He and his small entourage were imprisoned and interrogated. Half were allegedly tortured to death by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_slicing">slow slicing</a> with the application of tourniquets to severed limbs to prolong the torture. The bodies were unrecognisable. The Anglo-French invasion skirmished with Sengge Rinchen's Mongolian cavalry on 18 September <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zhangjiawan">near Zhangjiawan</a> before proceeding toward the outskirts of Beijing for a decisive battle in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhou_District,_Beijing">Tongzhou District, Beijing</a>. On 21 September, at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Palikao">Battle of Palikao</a>, Sengge Rinchen's 10,000 troops, including elite Mongolian cavalry, were completely annihilated after several doomed frontal charges against concentrated firepower of the Anglo-French forces, who entered Beijing on 6 October.</p>
<h3><strong>Burning of the Summer Palaces</strong></h3>
<p>With the Qing army devastated, Emperor Xianfeng fled the capital, leaving his brother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a>, in charge of negotiations. Anglo-French troops in Beijing began looting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace">Summer Palace</a>s in retaliation for Chinese atrocities. After Parkes and the surviving diplomatic prisoners were freed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bruce,_8th_Earl_of_Elgin">Lord Elgin</a> ordered the Summer Palaces destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The destruction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a> was discussed to exact revenge on the mistreatment of their prisoners. The Russian envoy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pavlovich_Ignatiev">Count Ignatiev</a> and the French diplomat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Louis_Gros">Baron Gros</a> counseled burning of the Summer Palaces instead, since it would not jeopardise the treaty signing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The June 1858 Treaty of Tianjin was finally ratified on 18 October 1860, bringing the Second Opium War to an end. The terms included: opening Tianjin as a trade port, ceding the No.1 District of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon">Kowloon</a> (south of present day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Street">Boundary Street</a>)&nbsp; to Britain, freedom of religion for Christians, freedom of navigation on the Yangtze, right of foreigners to conduct missionary activities, permission for British ships to carry indentured Chinese to the Americas, payment of an indemnity to Britain and France of 8&nbsp;million taels of silver apiece, and legalisation of the opium trade.</p>
<p>The Anglo-French victory was heralded in the British press as a triumph for Palmerston, which raised his popularity to new heights. British merchants were delighted at the prospects of the expansion of trade in the Far East. Other foreign powers were pleased with the outcome too, since they hoped to take advantage of the opening-up of China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Ignatiev forced the Qing government to sign a "Supplementary Treaty of Peking" which ceded the land east of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussuri_River">Ussuri River</a> (forming part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manchuria">Outer Manchuria</a>) to the Russians. The defeat of the Imperial army by a relatively small Anglo-French military force (outnumbered at least 10 to 1 by the Qing army) coupled with the flight (and subsequent death) of the Emperor and the burning of the Summer Palace, was a shocking blow to the once powerful Qing Dynasty. After this war, a major military and industrial modernisation movement, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement">Self-Strengthening Movement</a>, began in China in the 1860s and several institutional reforms were initiated.</p>
<p><strong>Xianfeng&rsquo;s Death, Tongzhi&rsquo;s Accession</strong></p>
<p>In September 1860, British and French troops attacked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a> during the closing stages of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War">Second Opium War</a>, and by the following month burned the Emperor's exquisite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace">Old Summer Palace</a> to the ground. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a> and his entourage, including Cixi, fled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a> for the safety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengde">Rehe</a> in Manchuria. &nbsp;On hearing the news of the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, the Xianfeng Emperor (who was already showing signs of dementia) fell into a depression, turned heavily to alcohol and drugs, and became seriously ill.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi#cite_note-5"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>On 22 August 1861 the 30-year old Xianfeng Emperor died at Rehe Palace in the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengde">Rehe</a> (now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengde">Chengde</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei">Hebei</a>). His successor was his one surviving son, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Emperor">Zaichun</a> (the Tongzhi Emperor), who was almost 6 years old. Before his death, he summoned eight of his most prestigious ministers, headed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushun">Sushun</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaiyuan">Zaiyuan</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanhua">Duanhua</a>, and named them the "Eight Regent Ministers" to direct and support the future Emperor. His heir, the son of Noble Consort Yi (future Empress Dowager Cixi), was only five years old. On his deathbed, the Xianfeng Emperor summoned his Empress and Noble Consort Yi, and gave each of them a stamp. He hoped that when his son ascended the throne, his Empress and Noble Consort Yi would cooperate in helping the young emperor to grow and mature. It was also meant as a check on the power of the eight regents. &nbsp;Upon the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Consort</a>, aged 25, was elevated to the title <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci'an</a>; and Noble Consort Yi, aged 27, since she was the mother of the now-reigning emperor, was elevated to the title Empress Dowager Cixi. By tradition, after the death of an Emperor, the body was to be accompanied to the Capital by the regents. Concubine Yi and the Empress traveled to Beijing ahead of time and planned a coup (the Xinyou Coup) that ousted Sushun from the regency. The Concubine Yi would subsequently rule China for the next 47 years, as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
<p>Xianfeng's reign saw the continued decline of the Qing dynasty. Xianfeng, like his father, the Daoguang Emperor, understood very little about Europeans and their mindset. While Westerners saw different nations as equals deserving mutual respect as an international norm, Xianfeng viewed non-Chinese Europeans as inferior and regarded the Europeans' repeated requests to be treated as equals as an offence. Xianfeng quickly rebuffed the Europeans suggestion of exchanging consuls. During the Second Opium War, repeated requests by Europeans to meet Xianfeng were also denied. At the time of Xianfeng's death, he had not even once met any foreign dignitaries.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Xinyou Coup</strong> <strong>辛酉政變</strong> <strong>(1861)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ousting Sushun</strong></p>
<p>By the time of the Xianfeng Emperor's death, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a shrewd strategist. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengde">Jehol</a>, while waiting for an astrologically favorable time to transport the coffin back to Beijing, Cixi liaised and plotted with powerful court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. Cixi's position as the lower-ranked Empress Dowager had no political power attached. In addition, her son the young emperor was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures. Taking advantage of the na&iuml;vet&eacute; and good nature of the late emperor's principal wife, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci'an</a>, Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning Empress Dowagers, with powers exceeding those of the Eight Regent Ministers.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi#cite_note-Edward_Behr_1987.2C_p._45-7"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>Tensions grew among the Eight Regent Ministers, headed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushun">Sushun</a>, and the two Empresses Dowager. Due to the long-standing Qing tradition that barred women from meddling in politics, the ministers did not appreciate Cixi's interference in political affairs, and the frequent confrontations left Ci&rsquo;an frustrated and angry. Ci'an often refused to come to court audiences, leaving Cixi to deal with the ministers alone. Hoping to oust the eight Regents, Cixi began gathering the support of talented ministers, soldiers, and others who were ostracized by the Eight Regent Ministers for personal or political reasons. Among them was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a>, who had great ambitions and was at that time excluded from the power circle, despite his being the closest relative of Xianfeng, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixuan,_Prince_Chun">Prince Chun</a>, the sixth and seventh sons of the Daoguang Emperor, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Emperor's funeral procession left for Beijing, Cixi took advantage of her alliances with Princes Gong and Chun. She and the boy Emperor returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the principal regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased Emperor's procession. Cixi's early return to Beijing meant that she had more time to plan with Prince Gong, and ensure that the power base of the Eight Regent Ministers was divided between Sushun and his allies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaiyuan">Zaiyuan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanhua">Duanhua</a>. The Regents were scapegoated for the humiliation of the Second Opium War, and were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the "barbarians" which had caused <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a> to flee to Jehol "greatly against his will," among other charges.</p>
<p>To display her high moral standards, Cixi executed only three of the eight regent ministers. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_slicing">slow slicing</a>, but Dowager Cixi declined the suggestion and ordered that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two also marked for execution, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, were given white silk scarves and allowed to commit suicide. The other five regents were spared, but dismissed from their duties. In addition, Cixi refused outright the idea of executing the family members of the ministers, as would have been done in accordance with Imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing Imperial tradition also dictated that women and princes were never to engage in politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Behind the Curtains</strong></p>
<p>In November 1861, a few days following the <em>coup</em>, Cixi was quick to reward Yixin, the Prince Gong, for his help. He was made head of the General Affairs Office and the Internal Affairs Office. However, Cixi avoided giving Yixin the absolute political power that princes such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorgon">Dorgon</a> had exercised during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunzhi_Emperor">Shunzhi Emperor</a>'s reign. As one of the first acts from behind the curtains, Cixi (nominally along with Ci'an) issued two important Imperial Edicts on behalf of the Emperor. The first stated that the two Empresses Dowager were to be the sole decision makers "without interference," and the second changed the boy Emperor's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_name">era name</a> from Qixiang (祺祥: "Auspicious") to Tongzhi (同治: "Collective Rule").</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Empress Dowager Cixi</strong><strong> 慈禧太后 </strong>(Regent 1861 &ndash; 1908)</h2>
<p>of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people">Manchu</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_%28clan%29">Yehenara</a> clan, was a powerful political figure and charismatic woman who unofficially but effectively controlled the Manchu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> in China for 47 years, from 1861 to her death in 1908.</p>
<p>Selected by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a> as a low-ranking imperial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concubine">concubine</a>, she gave birth to his only son, who became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Emperor">Tongzhi Emperor</a> upon Xianfeng's death. Cixi ousted a group of corrupt regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency over her young son with her former senior consort, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci&rsquo;an</a>. Cixi further consolidated control over the dynasty when, upon the death of the Tongzhi Emperor, contrary to the rules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_succession">succession</a>, she installed her nephew as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor">Guangxu Emperor</a> in 1875. A thorough conservative, she nonetheless half-heartedly supported the technological and military <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement">Self-Strengthening Movement</a>. Later, however, she undermined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days%27_Reform">Hundred Days' Reforms</a> of 1898, which she found impractical and detrimental to dynastic power. After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> and the subsequent invasion by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance">Allied armies</a>, external and internal pressures led Cixi to effect institutional changes of just the sort she had resisted. Three years after her death the dynasty collapsed, and China took on a republican form of government in 1912.</p>
<p>Some historians both in China and abroad have portrayed her as a devious and depraved despot and villain responsible for the fall of the Dynasty, while others have suggested that her opponents among the reformers succeeded in making her a scapegoat for problems beyond her control, that she stepped in to prevent disorder, that she was no more ruthless than other rulers, and that, shrewd and bright,&nbsp; she was even an effective if reluctant reformer in the last years of her life.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi#cite_note-1"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>
<p>Cixi was born in the winter of 1835 on Firewood Alley of West Sipailou, Beijing. In 1851, she participated in the selection of consorts for the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a> alongside sixty other candidates. The old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Xiaojingcheng">Dowager Consort Kangci</a>, foster-mother of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a>, hosted the selection of Xianfeng's consorts. Kangci supervised the entire process in the emperor&rsquo;s absence and made every decision on behalf of the emperor. Cixi was one of the few candidates chosen to stay, and was created Worthy Lady Yi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1854, Cixi was elevated to Concubine Yi, and in 1855, Cixi became pregnant. On 27 April 1856, she gave birth to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Emperor">Zaichun</a>, the Xianfeng Emperor's only surviving son. Soon afterward, she was elevated to the rank of Consort Yi. &nbsp;In 1857, when her son reached his first birthday, Cixi was elevated to the rank of Noble Consort Yi. This rank placed her second only to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">the Empress</a> within Xianfeng's harem.</p>
<p>Unlike many other women in the imperial harem, Cixi was known for her ability to read and write Chinese. This granted her ample opportunities to help the ailing emperor in daily tasks of governing. On various occasions, the Xianfeng Emperor had Cixi read palace memorials for him, and write instructions on the memorials according to his will. As a result, Cixi became well-informed on state affairs, and learned the art of governance from the ailing emperor.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Tongzhi Emperor </strong><strong>同治帝</strong><strong> (ruled 1861 &ndash; 1875)</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The only surviving son of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianfeng_Emperor">Xianfeng Emperor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>, Tongzhi came to the throne at the age of five and died at the age of nineteen. Tongzhi ruled under the regency of a triumvirate led by his mother, the Empress Dowager Cixi. He authored a short revitalization of the government through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Restoration">Tongzhi Restoration</a>, an unsuccessful attempt to stabilize and modernize China by restoring traditional order. The traditional Chinese political phrase "attending audiences behind a curtain" (垂簾聽政) was coined to describe Cixi's rule through her son. His reign, which effectively lasted through his adolescence, was largely overshadowed by the rule of his mother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tongzhi&rsquo;s Youth</strong></p>
<p>While there had most likely been hopes that Tongzhi would become a leader like the second ruler of the Qing Dynasty, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor">Kangxi Emperor</a> (who himself had succeeded to the throne as a child in 1661), those hopes soon came to naught, as Tongzhi grew into an obstinate and dissolute young man.</p>
<p><strong>Tongzhi's marriage</strong></p>
<p>In 1872, the Emperor turned 17. Under the guidance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci'an</a>, Tongzhi was married to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Xiaozheyi">Empress Jiashun</a>. Empress Jiashun's grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanhua">Prince Zheng</a>, was one of the eight ministers selected by Xianfeng to guide Tongzhi. He had been Cixi's enemy during the Xinyou Coup, and was ordered to commit suicide after Cixi's victory. Moreover, the Empress's zodiac symbol of the tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a sheep. According to Cixi's belief, it was a warning from God that she would eventually fall prey to the Empress.</p>
<p>As the principal consort of the Emperor, Empress Jiashun was well received by both Tongzhi and Empress Dowager Ci'an. Her personal consultants once warned her to be more agreeable and docile to Cixi, as Cixi was the figure who truly held the power. She replied: "I am a principal consort, having been carried through the front gate with pomp and circumstance, as mandated by our ancestors. Empress Dowager Cixi was a concubine, and entered our household through a side door."</p>
<p>Since the very beginning of his marriage, the Emperor proceeded to spend most of his time with his empress at the expense of his four concubines, including the Lady Fuca and Noble Consort Hui, who was the empress intended by Cixi. As hostility grew between Cixi and Empress Jiashun, Cixi suggested the couple spend more time on studies, and spied on Tongzhi using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch_%28court_official%29">eunuchs</a>. After her warning was ignored, Cixi ordered the couple to separate, and Tongzhi purportedly spent several months following Cixi's order in isolation at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Heavenly_Purity">Qianqing Palace</a>.</p>
<p>The young emperor, who could no longer cope with his grief and loneliness, grew more and more ill-tempered. He began to treat his servants with cruelty, and punished them physically for minor offenses. With the help of court eunuchs and Zaicheng, eldest son of Prince Gong and Tongzhi's contemporary and best friend, Tongzhi disguised himself as a commoner and secretly spent many nights in the brothels of Beijing. The Emperor's sexual habits became common talk among court officials and commoners, and there are many anecdotes of Tongzhi's escapades.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign influence</strong></p>
<p>China's loss in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War">Second Opium War</a> was undoubtedly a wake-up call for its imperial rulers. Cixi presided over a country whose military strategies, both on land and sea, and in terms of weaponry, were vastly outdated. Sensing an immediate threat from foreigners and realizing that China's agricultural economy could not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi made a decision that for the first time in Imperial Chinese history, China would learn from Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan">Zeng Guofan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo_Zongtang">Zuo Zongtang</a>, had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions. In support of these programs, Cixi also decreed the opening of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongwen_Guan"><em>Tongwen Guan</em></a> in 1862, a university-like institution in Beijing that hired foreigners as teachers and specialized in modern topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French, and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>China's "learn from foreigners" program quickly met with impediments. China's military institutions were in desperate need of reform, and Cixi's solution, under the advice of officials at court, was to purchase seven British warships. When the warships arrived in China, however, they carried with them boatloads of British sailors, all under British command. The Chinese were enraged at this "international joke," negotiations broke down between the two parties, and China returned the warships to Britain, where they were to be auctioned off. Scholars sometimes attribute the failure of China's foreign programs to Cixi's conservative attitude and old methods of thinking, and contend that Cixi would learn only so much from the foreigners, as would not infringe upon her own power. Under the pretext that a railway was too loud and would "disturb the Emperor's tombs," Cixi forbade its construction. When construction went ahead anyway in 1877 under Li Hongzhang's recommendation, Cixi asked that they be pulled by horse-drawn carts. &nbsp;Cixi was especially alarmed at the liberal thinking of people who had studied abroad, and saw that it posed a new threat to her power. In 1881, Cixi put a halt to sending children abroad to study, and withdrew her formerly open attitude towards foreigners.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Self-Strengthening Movement </strong><strong>(1861&ndash;1895)</strong></h2>
<p>was a period of institutional reforms initiated during the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> following a series of military defeats and concessions to foreign powers.</p>
<p>To make peace with the Western powers in China, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a> was made regent, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Council_%28Qing_Dynasty%29">grand councilor</a>, and head of the newly formed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongli_Yamen">Zongli Yamen</a> (Office of Foreign Affairs). He would be assisted by a new generation of leaders. Cixi was virulently anti-foreign, but she had to accommodate Prince Gong because he was an influential political figure in the Qing court. She would, however, become the most formidable opponent of reform as her political influence increased.</p>
<p>The majority of the ruling elite still subscribed to a conservative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucian">Confucian</a> worldview but, after China's serious defeats in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War">Second Opium Wars</a>, several officials now argued that in order to strengthen itself against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West">the West</a>, China must adopt Western military technology and armaments. This could be achieved by establishing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipyard">shipyards</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal">arsenals</a>, and by hiring foreign advisers to train Chinese artisans to manufacture such wares in China. It was believed that the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese civilization were superior to those of the West, and thus China would first learn from foreigners, then equal them, and finally surpass them. As such, the "self-strengtheners" were by and large uninterested in any social reform beyond the scope of economic and military modernization, modeled on the West.</p>
<p><strong>First phase (1861-1872)</strong></p>
<p>The movement can be divided into three phases. The first, from 1861 to 1872, emphasized the adoption of Western firearms, machines, and scientific knowledge, as well as training technical and diplomatic personnel through a diplomatic office and a college.</p>
<p><strong>The superintendents of trade</strong></p>
<p>As a result of treaties with the Western powers, the two ports of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Tianjin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> were opened to Western trade. Two officials titled Commissioners of Trade were appointed to administer foreign trade matters at the newly opened ports. Although ostensibly established to administer the new treaty ports, these two offices were actually intended to confine to the ports all diplomatic dealings with foreigners. Under their purview came the supervision of all new undertakings utilizing Western knowledge and personnel; thus, they became the coordinators of most self-strengthening programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> was the Tianjin Superintendent from 1870 and was so successful in taking over the functions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongli_Yamen">Zongli Yamen</a> that communication between the imperial court and the foreign diplomats at Peking were maintained under the auspices of the Self-Strengthening reformers.</p>
<p><strong>The maritime customs service (1861)</strong></p>
<p>A British national, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson_Lay">Horatio Nelson Lay</a>, was appointed Inspector General of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Maritime_Customs_Service">Imperial Maritime Customs Service</a>, which was established in April 1861. The office was designed to collect tariffs equitably and generate new revenues for the Manchu court from the import dues on foreign goods. Lay's main duty was to exercise surveillance over all aspects of maritime revenue and to supervise the Chinese inspectors who collected revenue at the various treaty ports.</p>
<p>The maritime customs service ensured the Chinese government a reliable and growing source of new revenue. Customs revenues increased from 8.5 million taels in 1865 to 14.5m taels (37.5 g) in 1885. Customs revenue paid off the 1860 indemnities, and furnished revenues for such new undertakings as the Peking Tongwenguan, the Jiangnan and Tianjin Arsenals, the Fuzhou Navy Yard, and the educational mission to the United States. The customs service also played an important role in checking smuggling. It also charted the Chinese coast and installed lighthouses, beacons, and other modern aids to maritime navigation.</p>
<p>In 1863, Lay was replaced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Hart,_1st_Baronet">Robert Hart</a>, who advocated establishing a national mint and post office, and tried to help China organize a modern navy. However, he was unable to win acceptance for any of his ideas because the Manchu court was not willing to allow foreigners to play an active role in the self-strengthening movement.</p>
<p><strong>Military modernization</strong></p>
<p>The most important goal of the Self-Strengthening Movement was to develop military industries; namely, the construction of military arsenals and of shipbuilding dockyards to strengthen the Chinese navy. The program was handicapped by several problems:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan">Zeng Guofan</a> established the Shanghai arsenal and oversaw developments in ship-building; Li Hongzhang built the Nanking and Tientsin Arsenal; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo_Zongtang">Zuo Zongtang</a> constructed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foochow_Arsenal">Fuzhou Dockyard</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9once_Verny">L&eacute;once Verny</a> helped build the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo">Ningbo</a> Arsenal in 1862-64, and the French officer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosper_Giquel">Prosper Giquel</a> directed the construction of the Foochow Arsenal in 1867-74. As these powerful regional strongmen were able to act independently of the central government, there was little coordination between the provinces and the government.</p>
<p>These military industries were largely sponsored by the government. As such, they suffered from the usual bureaucratic inefficiency and nepotism. Many of the Chinese administrative personnel were sinecure holders who got on the payroll through personal connections (关系).</p>
<p>The program proved expensive: Li Hongzhang had wanted the Kiangnan Arsenal to produce breech loading rifles of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Arms">Remington</a> type. Production finally started in 1871 and produced only 4,200 rifles by 1873, and these rifles were more costly than, and far inferior to the imported Remington arms. Shipbuilding efforts were also disappointing: the program consumed half of the arsenal's annual income but the ships built were at least twice as costly as comparable vessels available for purchase in Britain. The lack of material and human resources proved to be a formidable problem. The program was heavily reliant on foreign expertise and materials. The unavoidable growth in the number of foreign employees had made increased costs inevitable. Furthermore, officials were not even aware when the foreigners were not competent to perform the tasks that they had been hired to do. Laxity in procurement practices also contributed to escalating costs. Many opportunities for corruption existed in construction contracts and in the distribution of workers' wages.</p>
<p><strong>Prince Gong</strong></p>
<p>With the Taiping threat gone, Cixi focused on new internal threats to her power. Of special concern was the position of Yixin, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a>, whose loyalty network covered much of the country, and who had effectively garnered the support of the Han Chinese armies. In addition, Prince Gong controlled daily court affairs and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongli_Yamen"><em>Zongli Yamen</em></a>, the <em>de facto</em> ministry of foreign affairs. As Prince Gong&rsquo;s stature rose, Cixi increasingly saw him as a threat to her power. She set to work.</p>
<p>Although the Prince was rewarded for his conduct and recommendation of Zeng Guofan before the Taiping defeat, Cixi was quick to move after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cai_Shaoqi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Cai Shaoqi</a>, a little-known official who was the recorder at Court, filed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petition">memorial</a> asking for Yixin's resignation. Having built up a powerful base and a network of allies at court, Yixin considered the memorial insignificant. Cixi, however, took the memorial as a stepping stone toward Yixin's removal. In April 1865, under the pretext that Yixin had "improper Court conduct before the two Empresses," among a series of other charges, Yixin was dismissed from all his positions, but was allowed to keep his title. &nbsp;The dismissal, however, surprised the nobility and court officials, and brought about numerous petitions for his return. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yicong">Yicong</a>, the Prince Tun; as well as Yixuan, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixuan,_Prince_Chun">Prince Chun</a>, both sought their brother's reinstatement. Yixin himself, in an audience with the two Empresses, burst into tears. Bowing to popular pressure, Cixi allowed Yixin to return to his position as the head of the foreign ministry, but rid Yixin of his title of Chief Policy Advisor. Yixin would never return to political prominence, and neither would the liberal and pro-reform policies of his time. Yixin's demotion showed Cixi's iron grip on Qing politics, and her lack of willingness to give up absolute power to anyone, even her most important ally in the Xinyou Coup, Prince Gong.</p>
<p><strong>Second phase of Self-strengthening (1872-1885)</strong></p>
<p>In 1870 a number of foreigners were killed during riots in the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_Massacre">Tianjin</a>. This incident soured China's relatively stable relations with Western nations and marked the end of the first period of the Self-Strengthening Movement. By the second period, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> had emerged as the most important leader of the reform movement. He played a pivotal role in starting and supporting many of the initiatives during this period. Over 90 percent of the modernization projects were launched under his aegis. In addition to organizing and developing Western-style military academies, fortifications, and the fleet, Li also oversaw the development of capitalist enterprises, funded by private businesses with government involvement or oversight. These included railways, shipping infrastructure, coal mines, textile mills, and telegraph lines. However, the movement did not recognize the significance of the political institutions and social theories which had led to Western advances and innovations.</p>
<p>During this phase, commerce, industry, and agriculture received increasing attention. Attention was also given to the creation of wealth in order to strengthen the country. This was a new idea for the Chinese, who had always been uncomfortable with activities which create wealth from anything other than land. The development of profit-oriented industries such as shipping, railways, mining, and telegraphy were therefore rather new ventures for the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Chinese government sanctioned what was known as "government-supervised merchant undertakings." These were profit-oriented enterprises operated by merchants but controlled and directed by government officials. Capital for these enterprises came from private sources, but the government managed them and also provided subsidies in some cases.</p>
<p>Examples of such government supervised merchant undertakings include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Merchants_Group">China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company</a>, Kaiping Coal Mines, the Shanghai Cotton Mill, and the Imperial Telegraph Administration.</p>
<p>However, being supervised by the government, these enterprises could not escape the ugly aspects of government administration: nepotism, corruption, and lack of initiative. Managers also found ways to siphon off profits in order to avoid the payment of official levies and exactions. They also monopolized business in their respective areas, and by thus discouraging private competition, impeded economic development. Despite its economic inefficiencies, the merchant-bureaucrat combination remained the principal device for initiating industrial enterprises. The three-decade long Self-Strengthening Movement was generally unsuccessful. Many Qing government officials were skeptical and did not allocate enough attention or resources to the movement. Xenophobes who wanted nothing to do with Western civilization whipped up opposition to the movement. Many self-strengthening projects were funded by provincial governments or private enterprises, thus resulting in little benefit to the national interest, and even contributing to disunity and warlordism. Finally, self-strengthening was based on the flawed belief that military and economic modernization could be achieved without political or social reform.</p>
<p><strong>Tongzhi's deficiencies in ruling</strong></p>
<p>Tongzhi received a rigorous education from four famous teachers of Cixi's own choosing, who instructed the Emperor in the classics and various old texts for which the Emperor displayed little or no interest.</p>
<p>The pressure and stress put upon the young Emperor made him despise learning for the majority of his life. According to Weng Tonghe's diary, the Emperor could not read a memorandum in full sentences by age sixteen. Worried about her son's inability, Cixi only pressured Tongzhi more. When he was given personal rule at age 18, in November 1873 (four years later than was customary), Tongzhi proved to be an incompetent Emperor.</p>
<p>Tongzhi made only one important policy decision during his short rule, which lasted from 1873 to 1875. He decreed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanmingyuan">Imperial Summer Palace</a>, destroyed by the English and French in the Second Opium War, be completely rebuilt under the pretext that it was a gift to Cixi and Ci'an. Historians also suggest that it was an attempt to drive Cixi from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a> so he could rule without interference in policy or his private affairs. The imperial treasury was almost depleted at the time from internal strife and foreign wars, so Tongzhi asked the Board of Finance to scrape up the necessary funds, and requested that nobles and high officials donate their share. Uneasy about the Emperor's neglect of national affairs, Yixin (Prince Gong) and Yixuan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixuan,_Prince_Chun">Prince Chun</a>), along with the Court's top officials, submitted a joint memorandum asking the Emperor to cease the construction of the Summer Palace. Tongzhi, unwilling to submit to criticism, issued an Imperial Edict removing Yixin&rsquo;s title as Prince and demoting him to commoner status. Seeing the mayhem unfold from behind the scenes, Cixi and Ci'an made a dramatic appearance at court directly criticizing the Emperor for his wrongful actions, and asking him to withdraw the Edict; Cixi said that &ldquo;without Prince Gong, the situation today would not exist for you and me.&rdquo; Feeling a grand sense of loss at court and unable to assert his authority, the Emperor returned to his former habits. It was rumored that the Emperor caught <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis">syphilis</a> and became visibly ill. The doctors spread a rumor that the Emperor had caught smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, on 13 January 1875, the Emperor died and Cixi was back in power.</p>
<p>His death left the court in a succession crisis as he was childless. Eventually, the Dowager Empresses named Tongzhi's three year-old cousin (son of Prince Chun and Dowager Empress Cixi's sister), Prince Zaitien, as Tongzhi's successor, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor">Guangxu Emperor</a>, with the Dowager Empresses Ci'an and Cixi resuming their roles as regents. The Jiashun Empress died in March (coincidence?).</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Guangxu Emperor</strong> <strong>光绪帝 </strong><strong>(ruled 1875&nbsp;&ndash; 1908)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The reign of Guangxu (&ldquo;Glorious Succession&rdquo;) lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>'s influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He was taken from his home and for the remainder of his life would be cut completely off from his family. While addressing Ci'an conventionally as <em>Huang Eniang</em> (Empress Mother), Zaitian was forced to address Cixi as <em>Qin Baba</em> (親爸爸; lit. "Biological Father"), in order to enforce an image that she was the fatherly power figure in the house. &nbsp;He began his education at five, taught by Imperial Tutor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weng_Tonghe">Weng Tonghe</a>, with whom he would develop a lasting bond.</p>
<p><strong>Upbringing</strong></p>
<p>Zaitian was the second son of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixuan,_Prince_Chun">Yixuan, Prince Chun</a>, and his primary spouse was a younger sister of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>. When, on 12 January 1875 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Emperor">Tongzhi Emperor</a> died childless, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Ci%27an">Empress Dowager Ci'an</a> suggested enthroning one of Prince Gong&rsquo;s sons as the next emperor, but she was overruled by Cixi. Instead, breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor, Cixi nominated her five-year-old nephew and the imperial family agreed with her choice. Cixi adopted the boy as her son so she could act as regent and dominate the court, as she had since 1861.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Guangxu Emperor's accession</strong></p>
<p>Guangxu technically gained the right to rule at the age of 16 in 1887 after Cixi issued an edict for Guangxu to have his accession ceremony. Because of her prestige and power, however, court officials voiced their opposition to Guangxu's personal rule, citing the Emperor's youth as the main reason.Cixi, with her reputed reluctance, accepted the "advice" and legitimized her continued rule through a new legal document that allowed her to "aid" Guangxu in his rule indefinitely.</p>
<p>As his empress, and much to Guangxu&rsquo;s annoyance, Cixi chose her niece (Guangxu's cousin), Jingfen, who would become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Longyu">Empress Longyu</a>. Cixi also selected two concubines for him who were sisters, Consorts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_Jin">Jin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_Zhen">Zhen.</a> With Guangxu married off, Cixi retired from the regency, but continued to influence his decisions and actions. Guangxu eventually preferred to spend time with Zhen, neglecting his Empress, much to Cixi's dismay. In 1894, Cixi, citing intervention in political affairs as the main reason, degraded Zhen, and according to some reports, had her flogged. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third phase of self-strengthening (1885-1895)</strong></p>
<p>By this period, the enthusiasm for reform had slowed down to a crawl, as the conservative faction at court managed to overwhelm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a> and his supporters.</p>
<p>New types of enterprises sprouted in this period: joint government and merchant enterprises, even incipient "private enterprises." Whereas the Chinese government had traditionally discriminated against private merchants, the new encouragement of private enterprises seemed to mark a change in policy. However, the government was only interested in getting capital from private enterprises, and was still unwilling to let them take an active role in economic development. Thus, control of such enterprises remained firmly in the government's hands.</p>
<p>Examples of such enterprises included Kweichow Ironworks, established in 1891, and the Hupeh Textile Company, established in 1894. Like all other newly sprouted enterprises, they were very weak and represented only a small fraction of the total investment in industry.</p>
<p><strong>Court politics</strong></p>
<p>Two sources of conflict characterized Court politics during the period of the Self-Strengthening Movement. The first was the struggle for influence between the conservative and progressive/pragmatic factions in court. The other was the conflict between the central government's interests and new regional interests. These tensions determined the character and ultimately the successes and failures of the movement.</p>
<p>Both the conservative and the progressive factions believed in military modernization and adopting military technology from the West; where they differed was whether or not to reform the political system. Conservatives like Prince Duan, who were xenophobic and disliked foreigners, still adopted western weaponry and used it to equip their armies. During the Boxer Rebellion, the Conservative faction was led by Prince Duan and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang">Dong Fuxiang</a>, who equipped their troops with western rifles and weapons, but made them wear a traditional Chinese military uniform rather than a western style uniform.</p>
<p>The conservative faction was also led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>. She had to accept the reforms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Gong_%28Qing_dynasty%29">Prince Gong</a> and his supporters initially because of Prince Gong's role in helping her seize power and because of her relative inexperience in political affairs. However, as her own political acumen developed over the years, her support of either faction would depend on the political circumstances. Increasingly, fearing that reforms would undercut her authority, she began to undermine the influence of Prince Gong's faction by supporting conservatives' opposition to reforms. Self-Strengthening ultimately foundered due to lack of careful planning and coordination, an inadequate understanding of the West, lack of capital, corruption in the government, a shortage of competent officials, the conservative Qing approach, and foreign threats. China&rsquo;s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War proved once and for all that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be modernized if China was to survive in the brutal environment of the 19th century.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>First Sino-Japanese War </strong><strong>甲午戰爭</strong> <strong>(1894-1895)</strong></h2>
<p><em>Punch Magazine 29 Sep 1894 showing Japan bullying China</em></p>
<p><strong>The First Sino-Japanese War</strong> was fought between the Qing and Meiji Japan primarily over control of Korea. Korea had long been a vassal state of China, but its strategic location and coal resources attracted Japan&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>The war marked the emergence of Japan as a major world power and was a clear indication of the failure of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-strengthening_movement">Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military</a>&nbsp;and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially compared with Japan's successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_restoration">Meiji restoration</a>. &nbsp;For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing Dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a fatal blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a vassal state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of revolutions and political changes led by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-Sen">Sun Yat-Sen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei">Kang Youwei</a> that would culminate in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution">1911 Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>After two centuries of seclusion under the Edo shoguns, Japan was forced to open to the West by US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Kanagawa">intervention</a>&nbsp;in 1854. The years following the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>&nbsp;of 1868 and the fall of the Shogunate saw Japan transform itself from a feudal society to a modern industrial state. The Japanese sent delegations and students around the world in order to assimilate western arts and sciences; this was done to enable Japan to survive among the predatory Western powers. &nbsp;Korea continued to try to exclude foreigners, refusing embassies from foreign countries and firing on ships near Korea. At the start of the war, Japan had been reforming for three decades, while Korea under the Daewongun had suppressed attempts at reform, leaving it hopelessly backward.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict over Korea</strong></p>
<p>In order to protect its own interests and security, Japan wanted to block another power from annexing Korea, or at least ensure Korea's effective independence by developing its resources and reforming its administration. As Prussian advisor Major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Meckel">Klemens Meckel</a>&nbsp;put it to the Japanese army, geographically Korea was "a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan." &nbsp;Moreover, Japan craved access to Korea&rsquo;s coal and iron ore deposits and agricultural hinterland.</p>
<p>On February 27, 1876, after confrontations involving Korean isolationists and Japanese, Japan imposed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1876">Japan&ndash;Korea Treaty of 1876</a>, forcing Korea to open itself to Japanese trade. Similar treaties were signed between Korea and other nations.</p>
<p>Korea had traditionally been a tributary state and continued to be so under the influence of China's&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, which exerted large influence over the conservative Korean officials gathered around the royal family of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_Dynasty">Joseon Dynasty</a>. Opinion in Korea itself was split; conservatives wanted to retain the traditional subservient relationship with China, while reformists wanted to establish closer ties with Japan and western nations. After the two Opium Wars&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino%E2%80%93French_War">Sino&ndash;French War</a>, China was unable to resist political intervention and territorial encroachment by western powers. Japan sought to prevent any major power from dominating Korea, fearing that would pose a threat to Japan, and logically concluded that Japanese should replace Chinese influence in Korea. China&rsquo;s humiliations by Britain and France opened the door for Japan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kapsin Incident&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In December 1884 a group of pro-Japanese reformers, briefly overthrew the pro-Chinese conservative Korean government in a bloody three-day&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'&eacute;tat</a>. However, the pro-Chinese faction, with assistance from Chinese troops under General&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai">Yuan Shikai</a>, succeeded in regaining control with an equally bloody counter-coup, which led to Chinese domination of Korea from 1885 to 1894.These coups resulted not only in the deaths of a number of reformers, but also in the burning of the Japanese legation and the deaths of several legation guards and citizens in the process. This incident was eventually settled by the Sino&ndash;Japanese&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Tientsin">Convention of Tientsin</a>&nbsp;of 1885 in which the two sides agreed to pull their expeditionary forces out of Korea simultaneously; not send military instructors to train the Korean military; and notify the other side beforehand should one side decide to send troops to Korea, thus defusing tensions. Chinese and Japanese troops left, and diplomatic relations were restored between Japan and Korea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tonghak Rebellion</strong></p>
<p>Tensions were high by June, 1894, but war was not yet inevitable. A rebellion in Korea led the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojong_of_Korea">Korean king</a>&nbsp;to request Chinese troops on June 4 to aid in suppressing the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghak_Peasant_Revolution">Tonghak Rebellion</a>. The Chinese government sent General Yuan Shikai as its&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a>&nbsp;at the head of 2,800 troops. The Chinese government did not inform the Japanese government of its decision to send troops to the Korean peninsula, and in doing so failed to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Tientsin">Convention of Tientsin</a>. &nbsp;Japan then sent its own 8,000-man expeditionary force to Korea.&nbsp;Japan&rsquo;s request that China and Japan co-operate to reform the Korean government was refused. Korea&rsquo;s request that Japan withdraw its troops was also refused. The Japanese force of 8,000 strong subsequently seized the king, occupied the Royal Palace in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul</a>&nbsp;by early June 1894, and replaced the existing government with members from the pro-Japanese faction. A new government was formed July 25.</p>
<p><strong>Imperial Japanese Navy</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>&nbsp;was modeled after the British&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which at the time was the foremost naval power in the world. British advisors were sent to Japan to train, advise and educate the naval establishment; while students were in turn sent to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;to study and observe the Royal Navy. Through drilling and tuition by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>&nbsp;instructors, Japan possessed a navy expertly skilled in the arts of gunnery and seamanship.</p>
<p>Japan did not yet have the resources to acquire&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleships">battleships</a>&nbsp;and so planned to employ the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeune_%C3%89cole"><em>Jeune &Eacute;cole</em></a>&nbsp;doctrine which favoured small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, with guns powerful enough to destroy larger craft.</p>
<p><strong>Imperial Japanese Army</strong></p>
<p>The Meiji era government at first modeled the army on the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Army">French Army</a>. Nationwide conscription was enforced in 1873 and a western-style conscript army was established; military schools and arsenals were also built. In 1886 Japan turned toward the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Army">Prussian</a>&nbsp;model as the basis for its army. Its doctrines, military system and organisation were studied in detail and adopted. By the 1890s Japan had at its disposal a modern, professionally trained western-style army which was relatively well equipped and supplied. Its officers had studied in Europe and were well educated in the latest tactics and strategy. By the start of the war, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>&nbsp;could field a total force of 120,000 men in two armies and five divisions.</p>
<p><strong>Beiyang Army and Fleet</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>&nbsp;China did not have a national army. Following the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a>&nbsp;the army had been segregated into separate Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese">Han Chinese</a> armies, which were further divided into largely independent regional commands. During the war, most of the fighting was done by the Beiyang Army and Beiyang Fleet, since they were closest to Korea; pleas for help from other Chinese armies and navies were completely ignored due to regional rivalry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Army">Beiyang Army</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Fleet">Beiyang Fleet</a>&nbsp;were the best equipped in the new modern Chinese military, corruption was a serious problem. Military leaders and officials systematically embezzled funds, even during the war. As a result, the Beiyang Fleet did not purchase any battleships after its establishment in 1888. The purchase of ammunition stopped in 1891, with the funding being diverted to build the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace">Summer Palace</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a>. Logistics were also a huge problem, as construction of railroads in Manchuria had been discouraged by the conservative Court. The morale of the Chinese armies was generally very low due to lack of pay and prestige, use of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a>,&nbsp;and poor leadership which contributed to some rather ignominious withdrawals, such as the abandonment of the very well-fortified and defensible&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihai">Weihaiwei</a>.</p>
<p>The Beiyang Fleet was considered the dominant navy in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia">East Asia</a>&nbsp;before the first Sino-Japanese War. However, ships were not maintained properly and indiscipline was common. &nbsp;Sentries spent their time gambling, watertight doors were left open, rubbish was dumped in gun barrels and gunpowder for explosive shells was sold and replaced with cocoa. At the Yalu River, a battleship had one of its guns pawned by&nbsp;its Captain, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ding_Ruchang">Admiral Ting</a>.</p>
<p>The prevailing view in the West was that the modernized Chinese armies and navies would crush the Japanese. A British advisor to the Chinese military, William Lang, when interviewed by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuter">Reuter</a>s praised the state of the Chinese armed forces and its training, modern ships, guns, and equipment. He stated that "in the end, there is no doubt that Japan must be utterly crushed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Opening moves</strong></p>
<p>By July 1894 Chinese forces in Korea were numbered 3000&ndash;3500. They could only be supplied by sea through the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bay_of_Asan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Bay of Asan</a>. The Japanese objective was first to blockade <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asan">Asan</a> (near Seoul) and then encircle them with their land forces.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General">Major-General</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cshima_Yoshimasa">Ōshima Yoshimasa</a>&nbsp;led mixed Japanese brigades numbering about 4,000 on a rapid forced march from Seoul south toward Asan Bay to face 3,500 Chinese troops garrisoned at Seonghwan Station east of Asan and Kongju.</p>
<p>On 28 July 1894, the two forces met just outside Asan in an engagement that lasted till the next morning. The Chinese gradually lost ground to the superior Japanese numbers, and finally broke and fled towards Pyongyang. Chinese casualties amounted to 500 killed and wounded, compared to 82 Japanese casualties. The defeat of the Chinese at Asan precluded the possibility of a Chinese encirclement of the Korean capital, Seoul.</p>
<p>Following the Battle of Asan, formal declarations of war were issued by the Emperors of China and Japan. War between China and Japan was officially declared on 1 August 1894.</p>
<p>The remaining Chinese forces in Korea retreated to the northern city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>. The Qing government sent reinforcements and the 13,000&ndash;15,000 defenders made extensive repairs and preparations to the city, hoping to check the Japanese advance.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>&nbsp;converged on Pyongyang from several directions on 15 September 1894. Under the cover of darkness, the Japanese encircled and assaulted the city, eventually defeating the Chinese defenders. Taking advantage of heavy rainfall and using the cover of darkness, the remaining troops marched out of Pyongyang and headed northeast toward the coast and the city of Uiju. Casualties were 2,000 killed and around 4,000 wounded for the Chinese, while the Japanese lost 102 men killed, 433 wounded and 33 missing. The entire Japanese army entered the city of Pyongyang on the early morning of 16 September 1894.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yalu_River_(1894)"><strong>Battle of the Yalu River</strong></a></p>
<p>On September 17, 1894, Japanese warships encountered the larger Chinese&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Fleet">Beiyang Fleet</a>&nbsp;off the mouth of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yalu_River_(1894)">Yalu River</a>. It was one of the first modern navy battles between ironclad ships armed with rapid fire guns and torpedoes. However, the Japanese ships were heavier and had a larger number of rapid fire guns than the Chinese. In addition, the Japanese fleet had more experience, since Japan began its modernization years before China. The Chinese fleet suffered from a lack of discipline and corruption (some Chinese shells were found to contain sawdust and water). The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>&nbsp;destroyed eight out of the ten Chinese warships, assuring Japan's command of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea">Yellow Sea</a>. This&nbsp;was the largest naval engagement of the war and was a major propaganda victory for Japan. &nbsp;The Chinese fleet retired to Port Arthur for urgent repairs, but the port was soon threatened by the Japanese advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Invasion of Manchuria</strong></p>
<p>With the defeat at&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>, the Chinese abandoned northern Korea and instead took up defensive positions in fortifications along the Chinese side of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River">Yalu River</a>&nbsp;near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandong">Jiuliancheng</a>. On the night of 24 October 1894, the Japanese successfully crossed the Yalu River, undetected, by erecting a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontoon_bridge">pontoon bridge</a>. The following afternoon, they assaulted the outpost of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hushan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Hushan</a>, east of Jiuliancheng. The defenders deserted their positions and by the next day they were in full retreat from Jiuliancheng. With the capture of Jiuliancheng, General Yamagata's 1st Army Corps occupied the nearby city of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandong">Dandong</a>, while to the north, elements of the retreating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Army">Beiyang Army</a>&nbsp;set fire to the city of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fengcheng,_Liaoning">Fengcheng</a>. The Japanese had established a firm foothold on Chinese territory with only four killed and 140 wounded. The Japanese then advanced toward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden">Mukden</a>&nbsp;(Shenyang) and pursued fleeing Chinese forces west toward the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>. The Japanese 2nd Army Corps landed on the south coast of&nbsp;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>&nbsp;and laid siege to the strategic port of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushunkou">Lushunkou</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fall of Port Arthur</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan&rsquo;s navy landed troops on the strategic Liaodong Peninsula. By 21 November 1894, the Japanese had taken the city of&nbsp;Port Arthur. The Japanese army massacred thousands of the city's civilian Chinese inhabitants in an event that came to be called the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(China)">Port Arthur Massacre</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fall of Weihaiwei</strong></p>
<p>The Chinese fleet subsequently retreated behind the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihai">Weihaiwei</a> fortifications. However, they were then surprised by Japanese ground forces, who outflanked the harbor's defenses. After a 23-day siege, the fortress of Weihaiwei fell on 12 February, 1895. Japanese troops pressed further into southern Manchuria and northern China. By March 1895 the Japanese had fortified posts that commanded the sea approaches to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Occupation of the Pescadore Islands</strong></p>
<p>On 23 March 1895, Japanese forces attacked the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penghu_Islands">Pescadore Islands</a>, off the west coast of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. In a brief and almost bloodless campaign the Japanese defeated the islands' Qing garrison. This&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescadores_Campaign_(1895)">operation</a>&nbsp;effectively prevented Chinese forces in Taiwan from being reinforced, and allowed the Japanese to press their demand for the cession of Taiwan in the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Shimonoseki">Treaty of Shimonoseki</a>&nbsp;in April 1895.</p>
<p><strong>End of the war</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Shimonoseki">Treaty of Shimonoseki</a>&nbsp;was signed on 17 April 1895. China recognized the total independence of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire">Korea</a>&nbsp;and ceded the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan">Taiwan</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penghu_Islands">Penghu Islands</a>&nbsp;to Japan "in perpetuity." The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands_dispute">disputed islands</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands">"Senkaku/Diaoyu" islands</a>&nbsp;were not named by this treaty, but Japan annexed these uninhabited islands to Okinawa prefecture in 1895. Japan asserts this move was taken independently of the treaty ending the war, and China asserts that they were implied as part of the cession of Taiwan.</p>
<p>In addition to reparations, China signed a commercial treaty permitting Japanese ships to operate on the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River">Yangtze River</a>, to operate manufacturing factories in treaty ports and to open four more ports to foreign trade. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Intervention">Triple Intervention</a>, however, forced Japan to give up the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a>&nbsp;in exchange for 450 million&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen">yen</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Japanese invasion of Taiwan</strong></p>
<p>Several Qing officials in Taiwan resolved to resist the cession of Taiwan to Japan under the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Shimonoseki">Treaty of Shimonoseki</a>, and on 23 May declared the island to be an independent&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Formosa">Republic of Formosa</a>. On 29 May Japanese forces&nbsp;landed in northern Taiwan, and in a five-month campaign defeated the Republican forces and occupied the island's main towns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The war revealed the ineffectiveness of China&rsquo;s government and policies, and the corruption of the Qing administration. Although China had already been defeated by European powers in the 19th century, a defeat at the hands of fellow Asians and a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tributaries_of_imperial_China">former tributary state</a>&nbsp;was a bitter psychological blow.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia">Anti-foreign sentiment</a>&nbsp;and agitation would culminate in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>&nbsp;five years later.</p>
<p><strong>The Triple Intervention of 1895</strong></p>
<p>Although having achieved dominance in Korea, Japan was forced to relinquish the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula">Liaodong Peninsula</a> in exchange for an increased financial indemnity. The European powers, while having no objection to the other clauses of the treaty, did not want Japan to take Port Arthur, for they had their own ambitions in that part of the world. Russia persuaded Germany and France to join her in applying diplomatic pressure on the Japanese, resulting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Intervention">Triple Intervention</a>&nbsp;of 1895.</p>
<p><strong>Russian Ascendancy</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, it was Russia that reaped the greatest benefits from the war. Korea proclaimed itself the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire">Korean Empire</a>,&nbsp;announcing its independence from China. In 1895, the king of Korea fled to the Russian legation and reigned from there for two years. The concession to build a Seoul-Inchon railway granted to Japan in 1894 was revoked and granted to Russia. Russian guards guarded the king in his palace even after he left the Russian legation.</p>
<p>In 1898, Russia signed a 25-year lease on the Liaodong Peninsula and proceeded to set up a naval station at Port Arthur. Although this infuriated the Japanese, they were more concerned with Russian encroachment toward Korea than in Manchuria. Other powers, such as France, Germany and Great Britain, took advantage of the situation in China and gained port and trade concessions at the expense of the decaying Qing Empire.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao">Tsingtao</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiaochow">Kiaochow</a>&nbsp;were acquired by Germany,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwang-Chou-Wan">Kwang-Chou-Wan</a>&nbsp;by France and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihaiwei">Weihaiwei</a>&nbsp;by Great Britain.</p>
<p>Tensions between Russia and Japan increased in the years after the First Sino&ndash;Japanese war. During the Boxer Rebellion an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance">eight-member international force</a>&nbsp;was sent to suppress the uprising; Russia sent troops into Manchuria as part of this force. After the suppression of the Boxers the Russian government agreed to vacate the area. However, by 1903 it had actually increased the size of its forces in Manchuria. Negotiations between the two nations to establish mutual recognition of respective spheres of influence (Russia over Manchuria and Japan over Korea) were repeatedly and intentionally stalled by the Russians. They felt that they were strong and confident enough not to accept any compromise and believed Japan would not dare go to war against a European power. Russia also had intentions to use Manchuria as a springboard for further expansion of its interests in the Far East. In 1903, Russian soldiers began construction of a fort at Yongnampo but stopped after Japanese protests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1902 Japan formed&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Japanese_Alliance">an alliance with Britain</a>, the terms of which stated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and a third power entered the fight against Japan, then Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese. This was a check to prevent either Germany or France from intervening militarily in any future war with Russia. Japan sought to prevent a repetition of the Triple Intervention that deprived her of Port Arthur. The British reasons for joining the alliance with Japan were to check the spread of Russian expansion into the Pacific area, to strengthen Britain&rsquo;s hand, and to gain a powerful naval ally in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Increasing tensions between Japan and Russia as a result of Russia's unwillingness to enter into a compromise and the prospect of Korea falling under Russia's domination and undermining Japan's interests compelled Japan to take action. This led to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War">Russo&ndash;Japanese War</a>&nbsp;of 1904&ndash;05.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Hundred Days' Reform </strong><strong>戊戌變法 </strong><strong>1898</strong></h2>
<p>was a failed 104-day cultural, political and educational reform movement in 1898, undertaken by the young <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor">Guangxu Emperor</a> and his reform-minded supporters. The movement proved to be short-lived, ending in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"><em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em></a> led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning</strong></p>
<p>Guangxu ordered a series of reforms aimed at making sweeping social and institutional changes in response to weaknesses exposed by China's defeat by Japan, which had been regarded as a tributary state. Moreover, the defeat of China by Japan led to a scramble for 'privileges' in China by other foreign powers, notably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire">German Empire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russia">Russia</a>, further awakening the stubborn conservatives. Before the First Sino-Japanese War, China engaged in technological modernization only, buying modern weapons, ships, artillery, and building modern arsenals to produce these weapons, without making any institutional reforms, and refusing to reform according to western standards, as Japan had done.</p>
<p>Under the influence of reformers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei">Kang Youwei</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Qichao">Liang Qichao</a>, Guangxu believed that by learning from constitutional monarchies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a>, China would become more powerful politically and economically, and would be able to resist European imperialists. With the help of certain senior officials of the Qing court, who were supporters of reform, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei">Kang Youwei</a> was permitted to speak with the Emperor, and his suggestions were enacted. Some of Kang's students were also given minor but strategic posts in the capital to assist with the reforms. Some essential preconditions of reform were: modernizing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination">traditional exam system</a>, elimination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinecure">sinecures</a>, creation of a modern education system (studying math and science instead of focusing mainly on Confucian texts, etc.), changing the government from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy with democracy, applying principles of capitalism to strengthen the economy, reorganizing the military, and industrializing all of China through manufacturing, commerce, and capitalism.</p>
<p>The reformers declared that China needed more than "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement">self-strengthening</a>" and that innovation must be accompanied by institutional and ideological change. For a brief time, after the supposed retirement of the Empress Dowager Cixi, the Guangxu Emperor issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms. Conservatives like the xenophobic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaiyi">Prince Duan</a> opposed the reformers, suspecting foreigners were behind the plot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>
<p>The reforms, however, were too sudden for a China still under significant neo-Confucian influence, and displeased Cixi as they served as a serious check on her power. Some government and military officials warned Cixi of suspected Japanese influence within the reform movement, including a suspicious visit from Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi, and led Empress Dowager Cixi to resume the role of regent and once again take control of the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opposition to the reform was intense among the conservative ruling elite, who, condemning the announced reforms as too radical, proposed instead a more moderate and gradualist course of change. The privileged classes of Chinese society were threatened by the attacks on corruption, the army, and the traditional educational system. When Guangxu appointed two foreigners to his advisory council, conservatives feared a Qing government controlled by foreigners. With the tacit support of the political opportunist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai">Yuan Shikai</a> and the backing of conservatives, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a> engineered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"><em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em></a> on September 21, 1898, forcing the young, reform-minded Guangxu into seclusion. The Guangxu Emperor was taken to Ocean Terrace, a small palace on an island in the middle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongnanhai">Zhongnanhai</a> linked to the rest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a> only by a controlled causeway. Empress Dowager Cixi followed with an edict dictating the Guangxu Emperor's total disgrace and "not being fit to be Emperor." The Guangxu Emperor's reign had effectively come to an end. Until his death in 1908 Cixi held power as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent">regent</a>. The Hundred Days' Reform ended with the rescinding of the new edicts and the execution of six of the reform's chief advocates.&nbsp; Guangxu&rsquo;s supporters, including his former tutor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weng_Tonghe">Weng Tonghe</a>, who had recommended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei">Kang Youwei</a>, were exiled. The two principal leaders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei">Kang Youwei</a> and his student <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Qichao">Liang Qichao</a>, fled to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> to found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baohuang_Hui">Baohuang Hui</a> (Protect the Emperor Society) and to work, unsuccessfully, for a constitutional monarchy in China.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>The court put into effect some reform measures a decade later. These included the abolition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Examination">Imperial Examination</a> in 1905, educational and military modernization patterned after the model of Japan, and an experiment in constitutional and parliamentary government. The suddenness and ambitiousness of the reform effort actually hindered its success. One effect, to be felt for decades to come, was the establishment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Army">New Army</a>, which, in turn, gave rise to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord">warlordism</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the failure of the reform movement gave great impetus to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution">revolutionary</a> forces within China. Changes within the establishment were seen to be largely hopeless, and the overthrow of the whole Qing government increasingly appeared to be the only viable way to save China. Such sentiments directly contributed to the success of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution">Chinese Revolution</a> in 1911.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Boxer Rebellion </strong><strong>義和拳 </strong><strong>(1899-1901)</strong></h2>
<p>was a violent movement by the <em>Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists</em> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a> between 1899 and 1901. It expressed proto-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_nationalism">nationalist</a> sentiments and tried to eradicate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism">foreign imperialism</a> and Christian missions. The Great Powers intervened and defeated the government forces, in a humiliation for China.</p>

<p>The uprising took place against a background of severe drought and economic disruption in response to the growth of foreign <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheres_of_influence">spheres of influence</a>. Grievances ranged from political invasion resulting from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars">Opium Wars</a> to economic incursions to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian">Christian</a> missionary work, which the weak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty">Qing</a> state could not stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several months of growing violence against foreign and Christian presence in Shandong and the North China plain, in June 1900 Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a> with the slogan "Support the Qing, exterminate the foreigners." They forced foreigners and Chinese Christians to seek refuge in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Legation_Quarter">Legation Quarter</a>. In response to reports of armed foreign landings and demands, the initially hesitant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>, urged by the conservatives of the Imperial Court, supported the Boxers and on June 21 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Decree_of_declaration_of_war_against_foreign_powers">authorized war</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance">foreign powers</a>. Diplomats, foreign civilians and soldiers, and Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter were under siege by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers for 55 days. Chinese officialdom was split between those who supported the Boxer effort to destroy the foreigners and those officials seeking a diplomatic resolution. Clashes were reported between Chinese factions favoring war and those favoring conciliation, the latter led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yikuang,_Prince_Qing">Prince Qing</a>. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronglu">Ronglu</a>, later claimed that he acted to protect the besieged foreigners. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance">Eight-Nation Alliance</a>, after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and captured Beijing on August 14, lifting the siege of the Legations. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with the summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Protocol">Boxer Protocol</a> of September 7, 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and an indemnity of 67 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling">pounds</a> -- more than the government's annual tax revenue, to be paid as indemnity over a course of thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Origins of the Boxers</strong></p>
<p>The Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists was a secret society founded in the northern coastal province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong">Shandong</a> consisting largely of people who had lost their livelihoods because of imperialism as well as natural disasters. &nbsp;The group originated from the L&iacute; sect of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_gua">Ba-gua</a> religious group. &nbsp;Foreigners came to refer to the well-trained, athletic young men as "Boxers" because of the martial arts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics">calisthenics</a> they practiced. The Boxers' primary feature was a trancelike state, which involved "the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to Taoist and Buddhist spirits."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-7"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>The Boxers believed that through training, diet, martial arts and prayer they could perform extraordinary feats, such as flying. Furthermore, they popularly claimed that millions of <em>spirit soldiers</em> would descend from the heavens and assist them in purifying China of foreign influences. The Boxers consisted of local farmers, peasants, and other workers particularly from Shangdong province, made desperate by disastrous floods and famines, widespread opium addiction, and poor standards of living for which they blamed Christian missionaries, Chinese Christians, and the Europeans who were colonizing their country. At first, they wanted to destroy the Qing dynasty and rid China of all foreign influence. When the Empress Dowager backed the Boxers, the Boxers turned to ridding China of foreigners and Chinese Christians. The Boxers, armed with rifles and swords, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_spirit_possession">claimed supernatural invulnerability to blows</a> of cannon, rifle shots, and knife attacks. The Boxer beliefs were characteristic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism">millennarian</a> movements, related to such practices as the Native American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Dance">Ghost Dance</a>, another practice of a society under stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several secret societies in Shandong predated the Boxers. In 1895, Yuxian, a Manchu who was then prefect of Caozhou and would later become provincial governor, employed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Swords_Society"><em>Big Swords Society</em></a> in fighting bandits. The Big Swords relentlessly hunted the bandits, who would convert to Catholicism in order to gain legal immunity from prosecution and be placed under the protection of the foreigners. The Big Swords responded by burning Catholic churches. Yuxian was ultimately forced to execute the leaders of the Big Swords.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-12"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Causes of conflict and unrest</strong></p>
<p>International tension and domestic unrest fuelled the growth and spread of the Boxer movement. First, a drought in Shandong province in 1897&ndash;1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food. As one observer said, &ldquo;I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought... would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major cause of Chinese discontent was the Christian missionaries, both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant">Protestant</a> and Catholic, who came to China in ever increasing numbers. The extraterritoriality of the missionaries angered the local Chinese. In addition, Christians flouted traditional Chinese ceremonies and family relations. Missionaries also pressured local authorities to side with the Chinese Christians, who often came from the lower classes, in local lawsuits and disputes. On 1 November 1897 a band of twenty to thirty armed men stormed into the residence of a German missionary, George Stenz, and killed two priests who were his guests while looking for Stenz, who was sleeping in the servant's quarters. Christian villagers then came to his defense, driving off the attackers. This event was known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juye_Incident">Juye Incident</a>. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> received news of these murders, he dispatched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Asia_Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a> to occupy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozhou_Bay">Jiaozhou Bay</a> on the southern coast of Shandong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 1898, a group of Boxers attacked the Christian community of Liyuantun Village where a temple to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Emperor">Jade Emperor</a> had been converted to a Catholic church. Disputes had surrounded the church since 1869, when the temple had been granted to the Christian residents of the village. This incident marked the first time the Boxers used the slogan "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" (扶清灭洋) that would later characterise them. &nbsp;In Beijing the Boxers burned churches and foreign residences and killed suspected Chinese Christians.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-17"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>Aggression toward missionaries and Christians gained the attention of foreign governments. &nbsp;In 1899, the French minister in Beijing helped the missionaries to obtain an edict granting official status to every order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, enabling local priests to support their people in legal or family disputes and bypass the local officials. After the German government took over Shandong many Chinese felt that the missionaries and Christians in general were imperialists "carving the melon." A Chinese official expressed the animosity towards foreigners succinctly, "Take away your missionaries and your opium and you will be welcome."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-20"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>1900: A year of disasters</strong></p>
<p>In January 1900, the Empress Dowager changed her long policy of suppressing Boxers, and issued edicts in their defense, causing protests from foreign powers. In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians, and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Maxwell_MacDonald">Claude Maxwell MacDonald</a>, requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day more than 400 soldiers from eight countries disembarked from warships and traveled by train to Beijing from Tianjin. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 5 June, the railroad line to Tianjin was cut by Boxers in the countryside and Beijing was isolated. On 13 June, a Japanese diplomat was murdered by the soldiers of General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang">Dong Fuxiang</a> and that same day the first Boxer, dressed in his finery, was seen in the Legation Quarter. The German Minister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemens_von_Ketteler">Clemens von Ketteler</a>, and German soldiers captured a Boxer boy and inexplicably executed him. &nbsp;In response, thousands of Boxers burst into the walled city of Beijing that afternoon and burned many of the Christian churches and cathedrals in the city. American and British missionaries had taken refuge in the Methodist Mission and an attack there was repulsed by American Marines. The soldiers at the British Embassy and German Legations shot and killed several Boxers, &nbsp;alienating the Chinese population of the city and nudging the Qing government toward support of the Boxers. The Muslim Kansu braves and Boxers, along with other Chinese then attacked and killed Chinese Christians around the legations in revenge for foreign attacks on Chinese.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-25"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Conflicting attitudes within the Imperial Court</strong></p>
<p>On June 16, the Empress Dowager summoned the Court for a mass audience and addressed the choice between using the Boxers to evict the foreigners from the city and seeking a diplomatic solution. In response to a high official who doubted the efficacy of the Boxers' magic, Cixi replied, "Perhaps their magic is not to be relied upon; but can we not rely on the hearts and minds of the people? Today China is extremely weak. We have only the people's hearts and minds to depend upon. If we cast them aside and lose the people's hearts, what can we use to sustain the country?" Both sides of the debate at court realized that popular support for the Boxers in the countryside was almost universal and that suppression would be both difficult and unpopular, especially when foreign troops were on the march.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-26"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></p>
<p>With conflicting allegiances and priorities motivating the various forces inside Beijing, the situation in the city became increasingly confused. The foreign legations continued to be surrounded by both Imperial and Kansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Kansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's Imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow the Dowager Empress's decree and protect the legations. However, to satisfy the conservatives in the Chinese imperial court Ronglu's men also fired on the legations and let off firecrackers to give the impression that they, too, were attacking the foreigners. Inside the legations and out of communication with the outside world, the foreigners simply fired on any targets that presented themselves, including messengers from the Chinese court, civilians and besiegers of all persuasions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Cixi received an ultimatum demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, &nbsp;she defiantly stated before the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Council_%28Qing_Dynasty%29">Grand Council</a>, "Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?" &nbsp;It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the Peking Field Force armies, which began the siege. Cixi stated that "I have always been of the opinion that the allied armies were permitted to escape too easily in 1860. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come," and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided "great benefits" to China. The event that tilted the Imperial Government irrevocably toward support of the Boxers and war with the foreign powers was the attack of foreign navies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dagu_Forts_%281900%29">Dagu Forts</a> near Tianjin, on June 17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Siege of the Legations</strong></p>
<p>The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Legation_Quarter">Beijing Legation Quarter</a> south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a>. On receipt of the news of the attack on the Dagu Forts, the Empress Dowager immediately sent an order to the legations that the diplomats and other foreigners depart Beijing under escort of the Chinese army within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The next morning, the German envoy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Ketteler">Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler</a>, was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain. &nbsp;The other diplomats feared they also would be murdered if they left the legation quarter and they defied the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Isolated legations, such as the Spanish and Belgian, and foreign businesses were abandoned. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds. Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.</p>
<p>On 21 June, Empress Dowager Cixi declared war against all foreign powers. Regional governors who commanded substantial modernized armies, such as Li Hongzhang at Canton, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai">Yuan Shikai</a> in Shandong, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zhidong">Zhang Zhidong</a> at Wuhan, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Kunyi">Liu Kunyi</a> at Nanjing, refused to join in the Imperial Court's declaration of war and withheld knowledge of it from the public in the south. Yuan Shikai used his own forces to suppress Boxers in Shandong, and Zhang entered into negotiations with the foreigners in Shanghai to keep his army out of the conflict. The neutrality of these provincial and regional governors left the majority of China out of the conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese army and Boxers besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there. &nbsp;Under the command of the British minister to China, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Maxwell_MacDonald">Claude Maxwell MacDonald</a>, the legation staff and security personnel defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the <em>International Gun</em> because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian, and the crew American. Also under siege in Beijing was the Catholic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Saviour,_Beijing">Northern Cathedral</a> (<em>Beitang</em>), defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties from mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese built barricades surrounding the Legation Quarter and advanced, brick by brick, on the foreign lines, forcing the foreign soldiers to retreat a few feet at a time. This tactic was especially used to attack Prince Su&rsquo;s residence, defended by Japanese and Italian soldiers and inhabited by most of the Chinese Christians. Fusillades of bullets, artillery, and firecrackers were directed against the Legations almost every night -&ndash; but did little damage. Sniper fire took its toll among the foreign soldiers. Despite their numerical advantage, the Chinese did not attempt a direct assault on the Legation Quarter although in the words of one of the besieged, "it would have been easy by a strong, swift movement on the part of the numerous Chinese troops to have annihilated the whole body of foreigners... in an hour." &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 17 July, an armistice was declared by the Chinese probably due to the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the siege was at hand. The armistice endured until 13 August when, with an allied army approaching Beijing to relieve the siege, the Chinese launched their heaviest attack on the Legation Quarter. As the foreign army approached, Chinese forces melted away. The British Army relieved the legation quarter on the afternoon of 14 August. Beitang was relieved on 16 August, first by the Japanese and then, officially, by the French.</p>
<p><strong>Generals at cross purposes</strong></p>
<p>The Manchu General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronglu">Ronglu</a> had early on concluded that it was futile to fight all of the powers simultaneously, and declined to press home the siege. &nbsp;The Manchu prince <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaiyi">Zaiyi</a>, an anti-foreign friend of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang">Dong Fuxiang</a>, wanted artillery for Dong's troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from attacking. &nbsp;Ronglu and Prince Qing sent food to the legations, and used their Manchu Bannermen to attack the Muslim Kansu Braves of Dong Fuxiang and the Boxers who were besieging the foreigners. Ronglu also deliberately hid an Imperial Decree from General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nie_Shicheng">Nie Shicheng</a>. The Decree ordered him to stop fighting the Boxers because of the foreign invasion, and also because the population was suffering. Because parts of the Railway were saved under Ronglu's orders, the foreign invasion army was able to transport itself into China quickly. General Nie committed thousands of troops against the Boxers instead of against the foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Massacre of missionaries and Chinese Christians</strong></p>
<p>Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox missionaries and their Chinese converts were massacred throughout northern China, some by Boxers and others by government troops and authorities. By the summer's end, more foreigners and as many as 2,000 Chinese Christians had been put to death in Shanxi. Journalist and historical writer Nat Brandt has called the massacre of Christians "the greatest single tragedy in the history of Christian evangelicalism." &nbsp;A total of 136 Protestant missionaries and 53 children were killed, as well as 47 Catholic priests and nuns. Thirty thousand Chinese Catholics, 2,000 Chinese Protestants, and 200 to 400 of the 700 Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing were estimated to have been killed. The Boxers went on to murder Christians across 26 prefectures. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evacuation of Imperial Court from Beijing to Xi'an</strong></p>
<p>In the early hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, the Empress Dowager, dressed in the padded blue cotton of a farm woman, the Emperor Guangxu, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then ordered that the Emperor's favorite, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_Zhen">Consort Zhen</a>, be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a "tour of inspection." After weeks of travel, the party arrived in Xi'an in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a> province, behind protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Kansu Braves. The foreigners were unable to pursue, and had no such orders to do so, so they decided no action should be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p><strong>Occupation, looting, and atrocities</strong></p>
<p>Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities in northern China were occupied for more than one year by the international expeditionary forces. The German force arrived too late to take part in the fighting, but undertook several punitive expeditions to the countryside against the Boxers. Although atrocities by foreign troops were common, German troops in particular were criticized for their enthusiasm in carrying out Kaiser Wilhelm II&rsquo;s wishes. On 27 July 1900, Wilhelm II had spoken during departure ceremonies for the German contingent to the relief force in China, an impromptu, but intemperate reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun">Hun</a> invaders of continental Europe that would later be resurrected by British propaganda to mock Germany during World War I and World War II:</p>
<p><em>" Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name &lsquo;German&rsquo; be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German."</em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boxer_Rebellion#cite_note-73"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></a></p>
<p>The intermediate aftermath of the siege in Beijing was what one newspaper called "an orgy of looting" by soldiers, civilians, and missionaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was reported that Japanese troops were astonished at other Alliance troops raping civilians; Japanese officers had brought along Japanese prostitutes to stop their troops from raping Chinese civilians. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> journalist E. J. Dillon stated that he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops, and that thousands of Chinese women committed suicide to avoid that fate. A foreign journalist, George Lynch, said &ldquo;there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reparations</strong></p>
<p>After the capture of Peking by the foreign armies, some of the Dowager Empress's advisers advocated that the war be carried on, but the Dowager decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce as long as her continued reign was assured after the war and that China would not be forced to cede any territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 7 September 1901, the Qing court agreed to sign the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Protocol">Boxer Protocol</a>," which ordered the execution of officials who were found guilty of the slaughter of foreigners and fined China 450 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tael">taels</a> of fine silver (1 tael = 1.2 troy ounces). The reparations were to be paid over 39 years at 4 percent interest per year and would ultimately total 982 million taels. The sum of reparations had been determined by the Chinese population (roughly 450&nbsp;million in 1900), so that each Chinese person would pay one tael. When payments ceased in 1939, China had paid 668 million taels of silver, equivalent to $61 billion in 2010 purchasing power.&nbsp; By terms of the agreement, forts protecting Beijing were to be destroyed, Boxer and Chinese officials involved in the uprising were to be punished, foreign legations were permitted to station troops in Beijing for defense, and China was prohibited from importing arms for two years.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hay">John Hay</a> suggested that the US $30 million plus Boxer indemnity paid to the US be reduced to US$10.8 million and be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the US. Using this fund, the Tsinghua College was established in Beijing, on 29 April 1911. It was first a preparatory school for students to be sent by the government to study in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term consequences</strong></p>
<p>In October 1900 Russia was busy occupying the provinces of Manchuria, a move which threatened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_relations">Anglo-American</a> hopes of maintaining what remained of China's territorial integrity and which ultimately led to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War">Russo-Japanese War</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a> reluctantly implemented some reforms: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination">imperial examination</a> system for government service was eliminated; as a result, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classic_texts">classical system of education</a> was replaced with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts">European liberal system</a> that led to a university degree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect on China was a weakened dynasty, which was temporarily sustained by the Europeans. Behind the international conflict, ideological differences intensified between northern-Chinese anti-foreign royalists and southern-Chinese anti-Qing revolutionists. This scenario in the last years of the Qing dynasty gradually escalated to a chaotic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_era">warlord era</a> in which the most powerful northern warlords were hostile towards the revolutionaries in the south who overthrew the Qing monarchy in 1911. The rivalry was not fully resolved until the northern warlords were defeated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Expedition">Northern Expedition</a> of 1927.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Open Door Policy 門戶開放政策</strong></h2>
<p>is a concept in foreign affairs, which usually refers to the United States policy in late 19th century and early 20th century that would grant multiple international powers equal access to China. On paper, the policy was aimed at safeguarding Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity from partition. In fact, it was mainly used to mediate competing interests of the colonial powers.</p>
<p><strong>Formulation of the Policy</strong></p>
<p>After its devastating defeat in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War">First Sino-Japanese War</a>&nbsp;in 1895, China faced the imminent threat of partition and colonization by imperialist powers such as Britain, France, Russia, Japan and Germany. After acquiring the Philippine Islands at the conclusion of the the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-American_War">Spanish-American War</a>&nbsp;of 1898, the United States increased its Asian presence and was anxious to further its commercial and political interests in China. It felt threatened by other powers' much larger spheres of influence in China and worried that it might lose access to the Chinese market should the country be partitioned. As a response,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodville_Rockhill">William Woodville Rockhill</a> formulated the Open Door Policy in order to safeguard American business opportunities and other interests in China.&nbsp;U.S. Secretary of State&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hay">John Hay</a>&nbsp;sent notes to the major powers (France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia), asking them to declare formally that they would uphold Chinese territorial and administrative integrity and would not interfere with the free use of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_ports">treaty ports</a>&nbsp;within their&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence">spheres of influence</a>&nbsp;in China. These nations maintained significant physical and commercial presences in China, and were protective of their spheres of influence and trading privileges in Asia. The Open Door Policy stated that all nations, including the United States, could enjoy equal access to the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reply, each country tried to evade Hay's request, taking the position that it could not commit itself until the other nations had complied. In July 1900, in the absence of overt rejection of the Policy, Hay announced that each of the powers had granted consent in principle. Although treaties made after 1900 refer to the Open Door Policy, competition among the various powers for special concessions within China for railroad rights, mining rights, loans, foreign trade ports, and so forth, continued unabated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subsequent Development</strong></p>
<p>In 1902, the United States government protested that Russian encroachment in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>&nbsp;after the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>&nbsp;was a violation of the Open Door Policy. When Japan replaced Russia in southern Manchuria after the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War">Russo-Japanese War</a>&nbsp;(1904&ndash;1905) the Japanese and U.S. governments pledged to maintain a policy of equality in Manchuria. In finance, American efforts to preserve the Open Door Policy led in 1909 to the formation of an international banking consortium for Chinese railroad loans, though in 1917 the United States recognized Japan's special interests in China (the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing-Ishii_Agreement">Lansing-Ishii Agreement</a>). The Open Door Policy was further weakened by a series of secret treaties in 1917 between Japan and the Allied&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente">Triple Entente</a>, which promised Japan German possessions in China on successful conclusion of World War I.&nbsp;The subsequent exposure of this promise in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles_Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a>&nbsp;of 1919 angered the Chinese public and sparked the protest known as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Fourth_Movement">May Fourth Movement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Guangxu</strong></p>
<p>Returning to the capital in January 1902, after the withdrawal of the allied powers, Guangxu spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks, some say in an effort to pass the time until the death of Empress Dowager Cixi. He also read widely and spent time learning English from Dowager Empress Cixi's western-educated lady-in-waiting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Der_Ling">Princess Der Ling</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Death</strong></p>
<p>Under highly suspicious circumstances, Guangxu died on 14 November 1908, a day before Empress Dowager Cixi. He died relatively young, at the age of 37. Most historians are inclined to maintain that Guangxu was poisoned by Cixi or by Yuan Shihkai, for on his deathbed, Guangxu had left explicit instructions to execute Yuan Shikai. Medical records kept by Guangxu's physician indicate the emperor suffered from "spells of violent stomachache," and that his face would turn blue, typical symptoms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic">arsenic</a> poisoning. &nbsp;On 4 November 2008, forensic tests revealed the level of arsenic in Guangxu's remains was 2,000 times normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guangxu Emperor was succeeded by Empress Dowager Cixi's choice as heir, his three-year-old nephew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyi">Puyi</a>, who took the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_name">regnal name</a> "Xuantong." Guangxu's consort, who became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Longyu">Empress Dowager Longyu</a>, signed the abdication decree as regent in 1912, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Empress Dowager Longyu died childless in 1913.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Sun Yat-sen 孫中山</strong> <strong>(1866-1925)</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>was Hakka Chinese, born in Xiangshan (now Zhongshan) in Guangdong province to a family of poor farmers. At age 13, Sun joined his older brother in Honolulu, Hawaii, was a student at a British missionary school for three years, and then attended Oahu College, now known as Punahou School. Sun was sent back to China in 1883 by his brother who feared that he would convert to Christianity. Back home, Sun and a friend broke a statue of the Beiji Emperor-God, and Sun fled to Hong Kong, where he attended the Diocesan Boys' School. Later that year, he was baptized by an American missionary. In 1885, he married Lu Muzhen, a marriage arranged by his parents. In 1886, he enrolled in the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. Sun was troubled by the way China was clinging to its traditional ways under the conservative Qing dynasty, while suffering humiliation at the hands of technologically advanced nations. Around 1888, Sun joined a group of revolutionary thinkers, the Four Bandits, who were disillusioned with the Manchus' refusal to adopt more advanced scientific knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a Shanghai Methodist church in 1894, Sun met Charlie Soong, a Hakka businessman and missionary. Charlie had gone to the United States in 1878 at age 15 to look for work. He had been taken in by Methodist missionaries who soon converted him. Soong then joined the anti-Manchu crusade as Sun's chief supporter. Charlie Soong's three daughters, Soong Ai-ling, Soong Qing-ling (married Sun in 1915), and Soong May-ling (married Chiang Kai-shek) attended Wesleyan College in Georgia. His eldest son, T.V. Soong attended Harvard University and Columbia University, and later became the governor of the Central Bank of China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sun was impressed with foreign countries and Dewey's educational system. In 1892 he married Chen Cuifen and in 1894, aware of Manchu impotence, Sun wrote a petition to the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang presenting his ideas of military modernization by copying foreign technology. Ignored by Li, Sun went to Hawaii and founded the anti-Manchu Revive China Society. The members, mainly lower-class expatriates, swore to expel the Manchus. The Society spread to Hong Kong early 1895. That October, they planned an uprising in Guangzhou against the Qing, but plans were leaked, and more than seventy members were captured. Taking advantage of the defeat of China in the Sino-Japanese War, another uprising was planned in Canton in 1895, but it was also discovered, so Sun left China for 16 years in exile.</p>
<p>In 1896, Sun was detained for 12 days at the Chinese Legation in London by the Chinese Imperial Secret Service. He was saved by his former teacher at the Hong Kong College of Medicine, James Cantlie, as well as by intervention by<em> The London Times</em>, and British Foreign Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Japan in 1898, Sun met and befriended Mariano Ponce, a diplomat of the First Philippine Republic. Sun helped Ponce procure weapons and munitions to fight Spain and the US. Sun had hoped that he could use the Philippines as a staging area for a revolution, but had to give up this plan when the Philippine rebellion was crushed by the US in 1902.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen obtained a fraudulent Certificate of Hawaiian Birth, which stated he was born in Hawaii in 1870. Sun returned to Japan in 1905 and founded the Tongmenghui (United League) with Chinese students in Tokyo. By this time, Sun had begun developing his "Three Principles of the People": nationalism, democracy, and livelihood.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Yuan Shi-kai</strong><strong> 袁世凱 </strong><strong>(1859-1916)</strong></h2>
<p>Yuan's rise to fame began with his nominal participation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War">First Sino-Japanese War</a>&nbsp;as commander of the Chinese garrison forces in Korea. Unlike other officers, however, he avoided the humiliation of Chinese defeat by having been recalled to Beijing several days before the outbreak of the conflict.</p>
<p>As an ally of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a>, Yuan was appointed the commander of the first&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_army">New Army</a>&nbsp;in 1895. As the officer most directly responsible for training China's first modernized army, Yuan gained significant political influence and the loyalty of a nucleus of young officers: by 1901, five of China's seven divisional commanders and most other senior military officers in China were his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. The Qing Court relied heavily on his army due to the proximity of its garrison to the capital. Of the new armies that were part of the Self-Strengthening Movement, Yuan's was the best trained and most effective.</p>
<p>Yuan famously betrayed the Guangxu Emperor when Cixi planned the coup to end the Hundred Days Reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>, Yuan took the side of the pro-foreign faction in the Imperial Court, and&nbsp;refused to attack the Eight Nation Alliance forces, but joined with other Chinese governors whose modernized armies did not participate in the Boxer Rebellion. He ignored Cixi's declaration of war against the foreign powers and continued to suppress the Boxers. Furthermore, Yuan and his army helped the Eight Nation Alliance massacre tens of thousands of people in their anti- Boxer campaign&nbsp;after the Alliance captured Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 1902 Yuan was promoted to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy_of_Zhili">Viceroy of Zhili</a>, Commissioner for North China Trade, and Minister of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang">Beiyang</a>, comprising the modernized regions of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning">Liaoning</a>, Hebei, and Shandong. Having gained the support of foreigners for helping crush the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>, he successfully obtained numerous loans to expand his&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Army">Beiyang Army</a>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_army">most powerful army</a>&nbsp;in China.Yuan also gained control of the railways, and railway construction became a major source of his revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager and Guangxu died within a day of each other in 1908, and though the Emperor&rsquo;s will specifically ordered Yuan be executed, he was allowed to retire to his hometown on the pretext of having a foot disease.</p>
<p>During his three years of effective exile, he managed to keep the loyalty of the Beiyang Army. Having this strategic military support, Yuan held the balance of power between various revolutionaries (like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a>) and the Qing Court. Both needed Yuan on their side.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Xinhai Revolution </strong><strong>辛亥革命 </strong><strong>(1911)</strong></h2>
<p>named for the year 1911 in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar">Chinese calendar</a>, overthrew&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>'s last&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties_in_Chinese_history">imperial dynasty</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty">Qing</a>, and established the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)">Republic of China</a>. It arose mainly in response to the decline of the Qing state, which had proven ineffective in its efforts to modernize China and confront foreign aggression, and was exacerbated by ethnic resentment against the ruling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu">Manchu</a>&nbsp;minority. The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai">Yuan Shikai</a>, the Qing military strongman, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a>, the leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongmenghui">Tongmenghui (United League)</a>. After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_China_(1912)">provisional coalition government</a>&nbsp;was created along with the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_the_Republic_of_China">National Assembly</a>. However, political power of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_government">new national government</a>&nbsp;in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and decades of political division and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_era">warlordism</a> ensued, including several attempts at imperial restoration.</p>
<p>Today, October 10 is commemorated in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan">Taiwan</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ten_Day">Double Ten Day</a>, the National Day of the Republic of China. Many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Chinese">overseas Chinese</a>&nbsp;also celebrate the anniversary in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown">Chinatowns</a>&nbsp;across the world.</p>
<p><strong>Wuchang Uprising</strong></p>
<p>In the late summer of 1911, some Hubei New Army units were ordered to Hankou to quell the Railway Protection Movement, a mass protest against the Qing government's seizure and handover of local railway development ventures to foreign powers. Revolutionaries had made bombs, but on October 9, one went off prematurely at their headquarters in the Russian concession, and was investigated by the police who found a list of names of the conspirators. Revolutionary leader Xiong Bingkun decided not to delay the uprising any longer and launched the revolt on October 10, 1911.&nbsp;The entire city of Wuchang was captured by the revolutionaries by the morning of October 11. That evening, they announced the establishment of the "Military Government in Hubei of the Republic of China (ROC)."&nbsp;Qing requests for foreign assistance to put down the rebels were ignored, and cities and provinces began to declare their independence.</p>
<p><strong>Qing Constitutional monarchy</strong></p>
<p>During the&nbsp;Xinhai Rebellion, southern provinces declared their independence from the Qing Court, but neither the northern provinces nor the Beiyang Army had a clear stance for or against the rebellion. Both the Court and Yuan were fully aware that the Beiyang Army was the only Qing force powerful enough to quell the revolutionaries. The court requested Yuan's return on 27 October, but he repeatedly declined offers from the Qing Court, first to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy_of_Huguang">Viceroy of Huguang</a>, and then Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet. Time was on Yuan's side, and he waited, using his "foot ailment" as a pretext for his continual refusals.</p>
<p>After further pleas by the Qing Court, Yuan was finally persuaded to take up command of the army in return for the office of Prime Minister. He became Prime Minister on 1 November 1911. On November 3, the Qing court passed the Nineteen Articles, which turned the Qing into a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court changes were too late, however, and the emperor was about to have to step down.</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;Battle of Yangxia Oct 18-Dec 1, 1911, Yuan&rsquo;s forces recaptured&nbsp;Hankou</p>
<p>from the rebels, but Yuan knew that complete suppression of the revolution would end his usefulness to the Qing regime, so instead of attacking&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuchang,_Hubei">Wuchang</a>, he began to negotiate with the revolutionaries.</p>
<p><strong>Abdication of the child emperor</strong></p>
<p>The revolutionaries had elected&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-Sen">Sun Yat-Sen</a>&nbsp;as the first Provisional&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China">President of the Republic of China</a>, but they were in a weak position militarily, so they negotiated with the Qing, using Yuan as an intermediary. Yuan arranged for the abdication of the child emperor&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyi">Puyi</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuantong_Emperor">Xuantong</a>) in return for being granted the position of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China">President</a> of the Republic. Sun agreed to Yuan's presidency in return for having the capital in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. Yuan, however, wanted the capital to be close to his base of military power, so he fabricated a coup d'&eacute;tat in Beijing and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Tianjin</a> (Donghuamen Incident) to provide an excuse not to leave his&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence">sphere of influence</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei">Hebei</a>&nbsp;province. The revolutionaries compromised again, and the capital of the new republic was established in Beijing. Yuan was elected Provisional President of the Republic of China by the Nanjing Senate on 14 February 1912, and sworn in on 10 March of that year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tibetan independence</strong></p>
<p>By the end of 1912, the last Manchu troops were escorted out of Tibet.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thubten_Gyatso">Thubten Gyatso</a>, the 13th&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama">Dalai Lama</a>, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was resuming spiritual and political leadership of Tibet.&nbsp;Tibet enjoyed thirty years free of interference from China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Republican government in Beijing</strong></p>
<p>The government based in Beijing, called the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Government">Beiyang Government</a>, was internationally recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of China until 1928. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_National_Assembly_elections,_1912">first National Assembly election</a>s&nbsp;took place according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_China">Provisional Constitution</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>&nbsp;(KMT &ndash; Nationalist Party) was formed on August 25, 1912 and won a majority of the seats in the election.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Jiaoren">Song Jiaoren</a>, who had been openly critical of Yuan, was elected Premier. After arriving in Peking, the elected Parliament attempted to exert control over Yuan, develop a permanent constitution, and hold a legitimate presidential election. They were especially critical of Yuan's approval of $100 million in "reorganization loans" from a variety of foreign banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuan attempted to bribe KMT members in the two legislative chambers not to appear at the legislative session. Those who did not accept the offer were harassed and jailed. The Parliament was dissolved due to a lack of quorum and Yuan replaced them with a &ldquo;Council of State&rdquo; with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duan_Qirui">Duan Qirui</a>, his trusted Beiyang lieutenant, as Prime Minister. The KMT was further labeled an illegal party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 20 March 1913, while travelling with a group of friends to Peking, Song Jiaoren was shot by a lone gunman at a Shanghai railway station, and died two days later. The evidence led to the secretary of the cabinet of Yuan Shikai's government. However, the main conspirators investigated by authorities were either themselves assassinated or disappeared mysteriously, so, due to a lack of evidence, no one was ever officially charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 1913, the KMT instigated the Second Revolution as an attempt to overthrow Yuan Shikai. Seven southern provinces rebelled against Yuan. In September, Yuan took Nanchang and the KMT forces were broken. Yuan was elected president, and was recognized by foreign governments in exchange for autonomy for Mongolia (Russian sphere of influence) and Tibet (British sphere). Sun Yat-sen and the Soongs fled to Japan. A &ldquo;constitutional compact&rdquo; created by members of Yuan's cabinet gave Yuan unlimited powers. After his victory, Yuan reorganized the provincial governments by adding a military governor with control of his own provincial army. This decentralization laid the foundations for the warlordism&nbsp;that would cripple China over the next two decades.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Twenty-One Demands</strong> <strong>二十一條</strong></h2>
<p>Japan had gained a large sphere of influence&nbsp;in&nbsp;northern China and&nbsp; Manchuria&nbsp;through its victories in the&nbsp;First Sino-Japanese War&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Russo-Japanese war, and had thus joined the ranks of the European imperialist&nbsp;powers in their scramble to establish political and economic domination over China. With the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, and the establishment of the new Republic of China under General Yuan Shikai, Japan saw an opportunity to expand its position in China. Motivated to join World War I by a desire to expand its territorial interest, Japan formally declared war on Germany on August 23, 1914, and joined the Allied (Entente) Powers of WWI which included Great Britain, France, and Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 18, 1915, after capturing the German colony at Qingdao, with Europe distracted by the War, Japan sent a secret ultimatum, the Twenty-One Demands, to Yuan&rsquo;s government. The Demands called for recognition of Japan's paramount diplomatic and economic interest in Shandong province, extraterritoriality, concessions in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria, and joint control of iron and steel.&nbsp; The Demands were organized into five groups, of which Group Five was most contentious, ranging from appointing Japanese advisors to the Chinese central government and police force to allowing Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhist</a> preachers to conduct missionary activities in China.</p>
<p>Yuan attempted to stall for as long as possible and leaked the full contents of the Twenty-One Demands to the European powers in the hope that a perceived threat to their own spheres of influence would help contain Japan.</p>
<p>After China rejected Japan's revised proposal on April 26, &lsquo;Group 5&rsquo; was deleted from the document. A reduced set of "Thirteen Demands" was transmitted on May 7 in the form of an ultimatum, with a two-day deadline for response. Yuan, competing with other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord">warlords</a>, was not in a position to risk war with Japan, and accepted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement">appeasement</a>. The final form of the treaty was signed by both parties on May 25, 1915.</p>
<p>The results of the revised final (Thirteen Demands) version of the Twenty-One Demands were far more negative for Japan than positive. Without &lsquo;Group 5,&rsquo; the new treaty gave Japan little that it did not already have in China.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> expressed strongly negative reactions to Japan's implicit rejection of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Door_Policy">Open Door Policy</a>. On March 13, 1915, US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> affirmed Japan's "special interests" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong">Shandong</a>, but expressed concern over further encroachments to Chinese sovereignty. Japan dropped its odious demands that China accept Japanese policy advisors, and the US and Japan compromised with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing-Ishii_Agreement">Lansing-Ishii Agreement</a> of 1917, in which Japan vaguely accepted the Open Door.</p>
<p>In China, the overall political impact of Japan's actions was highly negative, creating a significant upsurge in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">nationalism</a>.</p>
<p>Japan continued to push for outright control over Shandong Province and won European diplomatic recognition for its claim at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> (despite the refusal of the Chinese delegation to sign the treaty). This in turn provoked ill-will from the US government as well as widespread hostility within China. The effects of the Twenty-One Demands were invalidated by the Washington Conference of 1921-22 when Japan agreed to withdraw its troops from Shandong and restore China&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Emperor Yuan</strong></h2>
<p>With his power secure and with the support of Japan, Yuan considered a revival of the monarchy, with himself as Emperor. He reasoned that the Chinese masses had long been used to autocratic rule, and that the Republic had only been effective as a transitional phase to end Manchu rule. Further, China's political situation demanded the stability that only a monarchy could ensure. American political scientist&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Johnson_Goodnow">Frank Johnson Goodnow</a>&nbsp;and Japanese negotiators concurred (perhaps one of the rewards for Yuan's support of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_Demands">Twenty-One Demands</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 20 November 1915, a "Representative Assembly" voted unanimously in favor of his becoming emperor. On 12 December 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China with the&nbsp;reign title of Hongxian (洪憲; i.e.&nbsp;Constitutional Abundance). The new&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_China_(1915%E2%80%9316)">Empire of China</a>&nbsp;was to formally begin on 1 January 1916, when Yuan intended to conduct the accession rites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuan expected widespread domestic and international support for his reign. However, he and his supporters had badly miscalculated. Many of Yuan's closest supporters abandoned him, and the solidarity of Yuan's Beiyang clique of military prot&eacute;g&eacute;s dissolved. There were open protests throughout China denouncing Yuan. International governments, including Japan&rsquo;s, proved suddenly indifferent or openly hostile to him, not giving him the recognition anticipated.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a>, who had fled to Tokyo and set up a base there, actively organized efforts to overthrow Yuan. Yuan's sons publicly fought over the title of "Crown Prince," and his former loyal subordinates like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duan_Qirui">Duan Qirui</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Shichang">Xu Shichang</a>&nbsp;left him to create their own factions. Faced with widespread opposition, Yuan repeatedly delayed the accession rites in order to appease his foes, but his prestige was irreparably damaged and province after province voiced disapproval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 25 December 1915,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan">Yunnan</a>'s military governor rebelled; the governor of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou">Guizhou</a>&nbsp;followed in January 1916, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guangxi</a>&nbsp;declared independence in March. Funding for Yuan's accession ceremony was cut on 1 March, and he formally abandoned the empire on 22 March after 83 days. This was not enough for his enemies, who called for his resignation as President. More provinces rebelled until Yuan died from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uremia">uremia</a>&nbsp;on 5 June 1916, at the age of fifty-six.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>&ldquo;No dogs or Chinese allowed&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Huangpu Park (黃浦公園) at the northern end of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund">the Bund</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> was established in 1886 to serve the growing number of foreigners living in Shanghai. The Public Garden was closed to Chinese people between 1890 and 1928 and, according to a popular myth, a sign at the park's gate read <em>No dogs or Chinese allowed</em>. However, there is no evidence that the sign ever existed in this form. In any case, the banning of Chinese from Huangpu Park and other parks in China has remained in the Chinese public consciousness as one of the many examples of the country's humiliation by the Western powers. A scene at Huangpu Park in the Bruce Lee film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_Fury"><em>Fists of Fury</em></a> features a (fictitious) sign that reads: &ldquo;No dogs and Chinese allowed.&rdquo;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Warlord Era</strong> <strong>軍閥時代</strong> <strong>(1916-1928)</strong></h2>
<p>As China sank into chaos, with the KMT banished, Yuan's lieutenant Li Yuanhong revived the Republican Constitution and became president. Li reconvened the National Assembly, but anarchy ensued, and China was left without any central authority. Many of the major warlords that came to power had originally served as officers in Yuan&rsquo;s Beiyang Amy. Other warlords came to power through their backing of provincial military interests or foreign powers, such as Japan.The warlords were not uninteresting, however. Feng Yuxiang, the "Christian warlord," baptized his troops before battle with a firehose and inspected their fingernails. Wu Peifu, known as the "Philosopher General," owned the world's largest diamond. Zhang Zuolin, the "Mukden Tiger," liked young boys, and had at least five wives. On August 24, 1917, when China declared war on Germany, warlords began to seize German assets in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Hankou. In 1917, Sun Yat-sen returned to China (in 1915, he had asked the Second International, a Communist organization in Paris, to help China establish the world's first socialist government). In 1921 he established a military government in Guangzhou (1921-1925) and later expanded into Wuhan (1925-1927). Sun began planning the Northern Expedition, a campaign to rid China of warlords and unite China.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The May Fourth Movement </strong><strong>五四運動 </strong><strong>(1919)</strong></h2>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference, ended World War I. In Article 156 of the Treaty, Germany's colonies in Shangdong were ceded to Japan. Protesting this move, in an upsurge of nationalism, thousands of student-led demonstrators took to the streets of Beijing on May 4, 1919 to denounce Japan and foreign imperialism, starting the event known as the May Fourth Movement. Strikes and boycotts erupted across the country, and cut across class lines. The Beijing government withdrew its delegates from the Peace Conference. (The Treaty of Versailles was finally signed October 21, 1919.) The May Fourth Movement marked the high point of an intellectual revolution in China against oppressive domestic policies and cultural conservatism. In the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-2, the sovereignty of Shandong was restored, but Japan sill maintained its economic dominance over the railway and the province as a whole.</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement took place just as the New Culture Movement (1917-1921) began to gain steam. This movement stressed Western ideas such as science and democracy, vernacular literature, education for girls, and emphasis on the future, and attacked traditional Confucian ideas and political conservatism.&nbsp; The diplomat and scholar Hu Shih was a prominent figure in both the May Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement. New writers of vernacular literature, such as Lu Xun, Lao She, and Mao Dun emerged. Leaders of the&nbsp;New Culture Movement&nbsp;believed that traditional Confucian values were responsible for the political weakness of the nation, and called for selective adoption of Western ideals of science and democracy in order to strengthen the new nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the May Fourth Movement was highly influential, many of the intellectuals at the time opposed the anti-traditional message and many political figures ignored it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, as a nationalist and Confucianist was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. As an anti-imperialist, he was skeptical of western ideas and literature. He and&nbsp;Sun Yatsen&nbsp;criticized the May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting morals of youth. When the&nbsp;KMT came to power under Chiang's rule, it carried out the opposite agenda. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Movement">New Life Movement</a>&nbsp;promoted Confucianism and the KMT purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Birth of Chinese Communism</strong></h2>
<p>Many Chinese intellectuals believed that the US had done little to sell the Fourteen Points, among them self-determination, at Paris, and observed that the US itself had declined to join the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>; as a result they turned away from the Western liberal democratic model. Marxism began to take hold in Chinese intellectual thought and communism began to be studied seriously by some Chinese intellectuals such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Duxiu">Chen Duxiu</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Dazhao">Li Dazhao</a>.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) traces its roots back to 1917, when its founders were inspired by the Bolshevik victory of the 1917 Russian Revolution. They saw Communist Revolution as an alternative response to colonialism. Li Dazhao, a future co-founder of the CCP, became chief librarian at Peking University (Beida) in 1918 and headed a Marxist study group, influencing several students, including Mao Zedong, who participated in the May Fourth Movement of 1919. Chen Duxiu, another future co-founder of the CCP, and a leader of the May Fourth Movement for Science and Democracy, attended Li's study group in 1919. Chen founded a magazine, La Jeunesse (New Youth &ndash; 新青年), to spread these new ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Comintern (Communist International), founded by Vladimir Lenin, sent agents to China in May 1919. The agents found two revolutionary movements (the study group at Beida and Sun Yat-sen's Republican movement). Comintern representatives met with Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu but, unimpressed by their naivet&eacute; and small core of followers, gave them instructions in Theory and Practice.</p>
<p>The official founding and First Congress of the CCP took place in July 1921, at a girls' school in Shanghai's French Concession. Twelve delegates and fifty party members attended. During the meeting, the school was raided, and the delegates fled and reassembled on a pleasure boat on South Lake in Zhejiang. Mao Zedong was among the attendees, and two years later, he was elected to the Central Committee. Over the next decade, Mao formulated his ideas on the role of the peasant (as opposed to the urban working class) as the vanguard of revolution.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The First United Front </strong><strong>(1922-1927)</strong></h2>
<p>In 1917, as China's southern provinces rebelled, Sun Yat-sen began to reassemble remnants of the KMT. Sun, determined to defeat the warlords, began to train an army with the help of Canton warlord Chen Qiu-ming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1923, with prompting from the Soviet Union, the First United Front was formed. It was an alliance between the KMT and the CCP, with the aim of eradicating warlords, imperialists, and the feudal autocracy in China. Under the First United front, the CCP renounced its autonomy and joined the KMT, which was headquarted in Canton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1923 the Sun-Joffe Manifesto was signed between the KMT and the USSR. In this agreement between Sun and Comintern agent Adolf Joffe, in return for weapons and training, Sun would accept Communist members into the KMT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1924 the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou was founded by the KMT with Soviet aid. Chiang Kai-shek, who had trained in the Soviet Union in 1924 and studied Russian military methods, became Whampoa&rsquo;s first commandant, while a young Communist and future Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, was appointed director of the political department of the Academy.</p>
<p>On March 12, 1925, Sun died of liver cancer, setting off a power struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, a left-wing KMT member, for control over the KMT. Chiang emerged as the leader of the KMT, but the United Front had already begun to deteriorate. The union was only held together by the two parties' mutual resentment of the warlords and of imperialism. Although Chiang doubted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen">Sun</a>'s policy of alliance with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> and CCP, he still needed aid from the Soviet Union, so he could not break up the alliance yet.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Northern Expedition </strong><strong>北伐</strong> <strong>(1927)</strong></h2>
<p>On July 9, 1926, Chiang took his 100,000 soldiers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Revolutionary_Army">National Revolutionary Army</a> (NRA), led by students trained in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whampoa_Military_Academy">Whampoa Military Academy</a> and equipped with Russian and German weapons, out on the Northern Expedition. NRA soldiers were far better organized than the warlord armies which they faced due to their military advisers, among whom was the famous Soviet General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Blyukher">Vasily Blyukher</a> (code-named Galen). In addition, the NRA was regarded as a liberating force on the side of common people persecuted by warlords, so it received strong support from the peasants. The NRA progressed from the Zhu River area to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River">Yangtze River</a> in less than half a year, defeating the warlords <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Peifu">Wu Peifu</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Plain_%28China%29">Central Plain</a> region and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Chuanfang">Sun Chuanfang</a> on the east coast, and grew from 100,000 to 250,000. The main remaining target in the north was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zuolin">Zhang Zuolin</a>, the warlord of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>.</p>
<p>By 1927, KMT forces turned against western imperialist powers, notably Britain. They seized the British concessions in Hankou, but Britain was determined to defend its interests in Shanghai. In the outskirts of Shanghai, a labor union general strike broke out, paralyzing the city. The communist-led unionists embraced the KMT. Chiang, however, formed secret alliances with the financial elite (including his brother-in-law) and the Green Gang in Shanghai to break up strikes and union meetings. Chiang decided to purge all Communists from the Kuomintang, so on April 12 he instituted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre_of_1927">Shanghai Massacre</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trotsky and Stalin </strong>The Northern Expedition became a point of contention in foreign policy between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Stalin followed an opportunistic policy, ignoring communist ideology. He told the CCP to stop complaining about the lower classes and follow the KMT's orders. Stalin believed that the KMT middle and upper classes would defeat the western imperialists in China and complete the revolution. Trotsky wanted the Communist party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and he opposed funding the KMT. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces could be squeezed of all benefit then discarded like a lemon. Chiang turned the tables on him, though, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre_of_1927">Shanghai massacre of 1927</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Shanghai Massacre</strong></p>
<p>In response to the advances of the NRA, Communists in Shanghai began to plan uprisings against the warlord forces controlling the city. On March 21&ndash;22, 1927, KMT and CCP union workers led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Duxiu">Chen Duxiu</a> launched an armed uprising in Shanghai, defeating the warlord forces of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhili_clique">Zhili clique</a>. The victorious union workers occupied and governed urban Shanghai except for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_International_Settlement">international settlements</a> prior to the arrival of the NRA's Eastern Route Army led by Generals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Chongxi">Bai Chongxi</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Zongren">Li Zongren</a>. After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Incident">Nanjing Incident</a>, in which foreign concessions in Nanjing were attacked and looted, both the right wing of the Kuomintang and western powers became alarmed by the growth of Communist influence, while the CCP continued to organize daily mass student protests and labor strikes demanding the return of Shanghai international settlements to Chinese control. With Bai's army firmly in control of Shanghai, on April 2, 1927 the Central Control Commission of KMT, led by former Chancellor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University">Peking University</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Yuanpei">Cai Yuanpei</a>, determined that CCP actions were anti-revolutionary and undermined the national interest of China, and voted unanimously to purge the communists from KMT.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrests and executions begin</strong></p>
<p>On April 5, 1927, Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai from overseas and met with CCP leader Chen Duxiu. After their meeting they issued a joint declaration re-affirming the principle of cooperation between KMT and CCP, despite urgent pleas from Chiang and other KMT elders to eliminate Communist influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 9 Chiang declared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law">martial law</a> in Shanghai and the Central Control Commission issued the "Party Protection and National Salvation" proclamation, denouncing the Wuhan Nationalist Government's policy of cooperation with the CCP. On April 11 Chiang issued a secret order to all provinces under the control of his forces to purge Communists from the KMT. Before dawn on April 12 gang members began to attack district offices controlled by the union workers. Under an emergency decree, Chiang ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias. The union workers organized a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_meeting">mass meeting</a> denouncing Chiang Kai-shek on April 13, and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more. Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control, and reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the KMT and under the control of Du Yuesheng. Over 1000 Communists were arrested, some 300 were officially executed and more than 5,000 went missing. Some NRA commanders with Communist backgrounds who were graduates of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whampoa_Military_Academy">Whampoa Military Academy</a> kept their sympathies for the Communists hidden and were not arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath and significance</strong></p>
<p>The KMT Central Committee, including Sun's widow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soong_Ching-ling">Soong Ching-ling</a>, publicly denounced Chiang as a traitor to Sun Yat-sen, immediately after the purge. But Chiang Kai-shek was defiant, forming a new Government at Nanjing to rival the Communist-tolerant Government in Wuhan controlled by Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>The rival KMT governments did not last long because the Wuhan KMT also began to violently purge Communists after Wang found out about a secret order from Stalin to Borodin to overthrow the left-wing KMT and take over the Wuhan government. More than 10,000 communists were arrested and killed within 20 days. Thousands fled to rural areas or remained underground in cities. The Soviet Union officially terminated its cooperation with the KMT while Wang, fearing retribution as a Communist sympathizer, fled to Europe. Afterwards the Wuhan Nationalist government disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Kuomintang. In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people died across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns executed by KMT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the remainder of 1927, the Communists launched several revolts in an attempt to win back power, marking the beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War</a>. With the failure of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Uprising">Guangzhou Uprising</a> (December 11&ndash;13, 1927), the CCP's eclipse was complete; it was two decades before they were able to launch another major urban offensive.</p>
<p>On the Communist side, Chen Duxiu and his Soviet advisers, who had promoted cooperation with the KMT, were discredited and lost their leadership roles in the CCP. Chen was personally blamed, forced to resign, and replaced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Qiubai">Qu Qiubai</a>, who did not change Chen's policies in any fundamental way. The CCP planned further worker uprisings and revolutions in the urban areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first battles of the ten-year Chinese Civil War began with armed Communist insurrections in Changsha, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantou">Shantou</a>, Nanchang and Guangzhou. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanchang_Uprising">Nanchang Uprising</a> in August 1927, Communist troops under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_De">Zhu De</a> were defeated but escaped from KMT forces by withdrawing into the mountains of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a>. In September 1927 Mao Zedong led a small peasant army in what has come to be called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Harvest_Uprising">Autumn Harvest Uprising</a> in Hunan province. It was defeated by KMT forces and the survivors retreated to Jiangxi as well, forming the first elements of what would become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army">People's Liberation Army</a>. By the time the CCP Central Committee was forced to flee Shanghai in 1933, Mao had established peasant-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_%28council%29">soviets</a> in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, transforming the Communist Party's base of support from the urban <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat">proletariat</a> to the countryside, where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_War">People's War</a> would be fought.</p>
<p>In June 1928, the NRA captured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a>, leading to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_reunification_%281928%29">nominal unification of China</a> and worldwide recognition of the KMT led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legal government of the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>Warlord counteroffensive</strong></p>
<p>The purge gave the warlords an opportunity to rebuild their armies. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Chuanfang">Sun Chuanfang</a> began communicating with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zuolin">Zhang Zuolin</a>, warlord of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>. Sun arrayed his forces along the Lower Yangtze, aiming to unleash an all-out attack upon the KMT and regain Nanking. The KMT, divided by political tensions and leadership conflicts, succumbed to Sun&rsquo;s surprise attack on July 24. His army tore through the surprised KMT forces and took Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu province. Chiang&rsquo;s armies retreated south and launched a counter-attack in August, resulting in a terrible defeat for the KMT. This defeat led to Chiang's immediate resignation on Aug. 6th as head of the Nanking Government, prompting him to move to Shanghai. Li Zongren moved the whole NRA to the Yangtze to defend Nanking. On August 25, Sun Chuanfang's army, now close to the Yangtze, launched an all-out attack upon the KMT forces at Longtan, a vital supply route between Nanking and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. Chiang&rsquo;s forces were initially pushed out, but regained the city on August 30.</p>
<p><strong>Second Northern Expedition</strong></p>
<p>On January 2, 1928 the leftist KMT government in Wuhan finally reconciled with Chiang and formally merged with the Nanking Government. In response to the recapture of Xuzhou by the KMT, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zuolin">Zhang Zuolin</a> recruited Sun&rsquo;s troops to join his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anguo-jun_Army&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Anguo Army</a>. On April 2, Chiang ordered the beginning of the Second Northern Expedition. The Nationalists swept across the remains of Sun&rsquo;s forces and reached the Yellow River in mid-April. Meanwhile in Manchuria, Zhang Zuolin was assassinated by conspirators from Japan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Army">Kwantung Army</a>. Due to his hatred of the Japanese, who had killed his father, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Xueliang">Zhang Xueliang</a>, the new warlord of Manchuria decided to cooperate with Chiang and the KMT, thus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_reunification_%281928%29">nominally uniting China</a> under one state.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>The Northern Expedition is viewed positively in China today because it ended a period of disorder and started the formation of an effective central government. However, it did not fully solve the warlord problem, as many warlords still had large armies that served their needs, not those of China. This is because of their alliance with the KMT. They acted as franchisees of the party, wore NRA uniforms, and espoused the party doctrine. Wars between these new warlords would claim more lives than ever in the 1930s and prove to be a major problem for the KMT right up to 1949.</p>
<p>Chiang benefited most from the expedition, however, for the victory achieved his personal goal of becoming paramount leader. Furthermore, Chiang made the military command superior to KMT party leadership, which resulted in his later dictatorship.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Jiangxi Soviet</strong><strong> (1930)</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the CCP split into several groups: some fled to Moscow in exile, and &ldquo;White Area CCP" stayed in cities, hiding from gangs aligned with the KMT, while "Red Area CCP" went to the mountains and staged local uprisings in Nanchang and then in Hunan. Because of the events of April 1927, the Comintern broke ties with the KMT. The left-wing leader of the KMT Wang Jingwei and his allies moved the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to Wuhan, while Chiang's rival right-wing, anti-Communist KMT regime was established at Nanjing in April of 1927. The Autumn Harvest Uprising, led by Mao Zedong, erupted in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces in September 1927. The peasant army, led by Mao, caused radical upheaval for several weeks, leaving the landowning classes trembling. When the uprising was defeated by the KMT, Mao was forced to retreat to Jiangxi province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Communists led by Mao Zedong, using guerrilla warfare in the mountain regions against KMT attacks, merged with another group led by Zhu De. The Jiangxi Soviet in southern China, located between Fujian and Hunan provinces, was a rural communist base, established in November 7, 1931 with the first National Congress of the Chinese Soviet Republic. The headquarters of the Chinese Soviet government was located at the town of Ruijin. Mao Zedong was elected both the Head of State and the Head of Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic. CCP membership grew as more peasants were recruited. In line with the Communists' signature social program for land reform, the lands of the wealthy were confiscated and distributed to the peasants.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Soviet was attacked by nationalist KMT forces during their Encirclement Campaigns of the early 1930s, but the first few campaigns were thwarted by the Communists' guerilla strategies. However, the end of the Jiangxi Soviet came in 1934, when KMT forces led by Chiang Kai-shek eventually forced the Red Army to retreat, on the Long March, to Shaanxi in northern China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principles of the Red Army&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"The enemy advances, we retreat. The enemy camps, we harass. The enemy tires,&nbsp; we attack. The enemy retreats, we pursue."</p>
<p>Because the Red Army was poorly equipped, soldiers employed guerilla tactics. The communists adhered to the "fish in water" theory: guerillas were the "fish" and the peasants were the "water." The Red Army must, therefore, lead by example, and instead of coercing the masses, live and work among people. There were also strict rules of behavior for the Red Army in regard to the treatment of civilians. Rules included: obey all orders, refrain from taking anything, speak politely, and turn in everything captured. In addition the troops performed normal civilian functions such as farming and teaching.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Manchukuo </strong><strong>(1931)</strong></h2>
<p>The chaotic situation in China provided an excellent opportunity for Japanese expansionism. Japan saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from many Western countries by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Depression</a> era <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff">tariffs</a>), and as a protective <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state">buffer state</a> against the Soviet Union in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had gained control of the South Manchurian Railway, establishing its presence in Manchuria. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria">Japan invaded Manchuria</a> after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden_Incident">Mukden Incident</a>, staged by Japan in September 1931, and encountered no organized resistance from the KMT. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state">puppet state</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchukuo">Manchukuo</a> was established in 1932, with the last Qing emperor of China, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyi">Puyi</a>, installed as ruler. China appealed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a> for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Report">Lytton Report</a>, condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, and inducing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country was willing to take action against Japan beyond this tepid censure.</p>


h1><strong>The Long March</strong> <strong>紅軍長征</strong><strong> (1934-35)</strong></h2>
<p>was a military retreat undertaken by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Liberation_Army">Red Army</a> to evade the pursuit of the KMT army. Encircled by the KMT, the Communists, under the eventual command of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed some 8,000 miles over 370 days. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>.</p>
<p>The Long March began <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>'s ascent to power, whose leadership during the retreat gained him the support of the members of the party. The bitter struggles of the Long March, which was completed by only about one-tenth of the force that left Jiangxi, would come to represent a significant episode in the history of the CCP, and would seal the personal prestige of Mao and his supporters as the new leaders of the party in the following decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chiang's Encirclement Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>In August 1934, with the Red Army depleted by prolonged conflict, a spy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Xiong">Mo Xiong</a>, placed by Zhou Enlai in the KMT army headquarters in Nanchang brought news that Chiang Kai-shek was preparing a major offensive against the Communist capital, Ruijin. The Communist leadership decided on a strategic retreat to regroup with other Communist units, and to avoid annihilation.</p>
<p><strong>Escape from Jiangxi</strong></p>
<p>The withdrawal began in early October 1934. Zhou's intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang's blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Jitang">Chen Jitang</a>, a Guangdong warlord whom Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting. Zhou sent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Hannian">Pan Hannian</a> to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting. The Red army successfully crossed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinfeng_River">Xinfeng River</a> and marched through the province of Guangdong and into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan">Hunan</a> before encountering the last of Chiang's fortifications at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_River">Xiang River</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Escaping Chiang's pursuit</strong></p>
<p>When the army resumed its march northward, the direct route to Sichuan was blocked by Chiang's forces. Mao's forces spent the next several months maneuvering to avoid direct confrontation with hostile forces, but still attempting to move north to join <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Guotao">Zhang Guotao</a>'s Fourth Red Army. The Communist forces were harassed by both the KMT and its local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_era">warlord allies</a>. To avoid a fatal confrontation with the enemy, Zhou and Mao maneuvered the Red army south and west, through Guizhou, Sichuan, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, feigning attacks on Guiyang and Kunming to disguise their movements. The Red Army had to cross mountains and rivers, often capturing river crossings heavily defended by hostile warlords and Nationalist troops, the most famous of which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luding_Bridge">Luding Bridge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reaching Yan'an</strong></p>
<p>Mao's First Red Army traversed several swamps and was attacked by Muslim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people">Hui</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Clique">Ma Clique</a> forces under Generals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Bufang">Ma Bufang</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Buqing">Ma Buqing</a>. Finally, in October 1935, Mao's army reached Shaanxi province and joined with local Communist forces there, ending the Long March.</p>
<p>All along the way, the Communist Army confiscated property and weapons from local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord">warlords</a> and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor. Nevertheless, only some 8,000 troops under Mao's command, the First Front Army, ultimately made it to the final destination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan%27an">Yan'an</a> in 1935. Of these, fewer than 7,000 were among the original 100,000 soldiers who had started the March. A variety of factors contributed to the losses including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_%28physical%29">fatigue</a>, hunger and cold, sickness, desertion, and military casualties. During the retreat, membership in the party fell from 300,000 to around 40,000. In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Xi&rsquo;an Incident</strong><strong> (1936)</strong></h2>
<p>After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang Xueliang and his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fengtian_clique">Northeast Army</a> were tasked with suppressing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Red_Army">Red Army</a> after their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March">Long March</a>. This resulted in severe casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support from Chiang. On 12 December 1936 a deeply disgruntled Zhang <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Incident">kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>, hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CCP. The KMT agreed to a Second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_United_Front_%28China%29">United Front</a> with the CCP against Japan, and the Red Army fought together with KMT forces during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taiyuan">Battles of Taiyuan</a>, and Wuhan.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Second Sino-Japanese War</strong> <strong>抗日戰爭</strong> <strong>(1937&ndash;45)</strong></h2>
<p>On July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire at Lugou (Marco Polo) Bridge, a crucial access route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle, in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beiping%E2%80%93Tianjin">Beijing</a> and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces and the Second Sino-Japanese War began.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> mobilized the army and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Chinese_Nationalist_air_force_%281937%E2%80%931945%29">air force</a> to repulse the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Land_Forces">Japanese </a>attack on Shanghai of August 13, 1937, but after more than three months of intense fighting, Shanghai fell.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rape of Nanking</strong></p>
<p>In December, the Imperial Japanese Army captured the KMT capital city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing">Nanking</a>. Historians estimate up to 300,000 Chinese were raped, tortured and murdered in what became known as the Rape of Nanking, six weeks of carnage from December 13, 1937 to late January 1938, though some Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism_%28negationism%29#Japanese_war_crimes">deny</a> that the massacre occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chiang hunkers down in Sichuan</strong></p>
<p>At the start of 1938, the leadership in Tokyo still hoped to limit the scope of the conflict to occupy areas around Shanghai, Nanjing and northern China to preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government had effectively lost control of the notorious Kwantung Army in China. Chiang adopted the strategy of "trading space for time." In order to allow professionals and key industries to retreat west into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing">Chongqing</a>, Chiang delayed the Japanese advance by breaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam">dams</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee">levees</a> to slow the Japanese, flooding many Chinese villages, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless. The Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wuhan">captured Wuhan</a> on October 27, 1938, forcing Chiang to retreat to Chungking, where he remained until Japan&rsquo;s defeat in 1945.</p>
<p>Japan attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#Japanese_bombing">massive air raids</a> on civilian targets. Japanese bombers hit the KMT's newly established <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing">provisional capital of Chungking</a> and other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions more dead, injured, and homeless.</p>
<p>On 30 March 1940 the Japanese created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state">puppet government</a> favorable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, headed by former KMT premier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jingwei">Wang Jingwei</a>. By late 1940, the war had descended into stalemate.</p>
<p>On 15 April 1941, FDR authorized the creation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Volunteer_Group">American Volunteer Group</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Tigers">Flying Tigers</a>), to replace the withdrawn Soviet volunteers and aircraft. Led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Lee_Chennault">Claire Lee Chennault</a>, their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their shark-painted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_P-40">P-40</a> fighters earned them wide recognition at a time when the Allies were suffering heavy losses, and soon their dog-fighting tactics would be adopted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces">US Army Air Forces</a>.</p>
<p>On 21 July 1941 Japan occupied French Indochina, contravening a 1940 "Gentlemen's Agreement" and threatening British and Dutch colonies. On 24 July Roosevelt demanded Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the US and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long term basis and set the stage for Japan&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek continued to receive supplies from the United States as the Chinese conflict was merged into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War">Asian theatre of World War II</a>. Sea routes to China and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan%E2%80%93Vietnam_Railway">Yunnan&ndash;Vietnam Railway</a> had been closed since 1940, so, between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_conquest_of_Burma">closing of the Burma Road</a> in 1942 and its re-opening as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledo_Road">Ledo Road</a> in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hump">The Hump</a>" (the Himalayas). American general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stilwell">Joseph Stilwell</a> served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Burma_India_Theater_of_World_War_II">China-Burma-India Theater</a>. Relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down, largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the KMT government, but also because Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred to wait out the Japanese, since he believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. The Allies gradually began to lose confidence in Chiang&rsquo;s willingness to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean_Areas_%28command%29">Pacific</a>, employing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging_%28strategy%29">island-hopping</a> strategy &mdash; bypassing heavily fortified Japanese positions and concentrating on securing strategically important small, less-defended islands.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">US</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> put an end to the Sino-Japanese War (and World War II) by attacking the Japanese with a new weapon (on America's part) and an incursion into Manchuria (on the Soviet part). On August 6, an American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress">B-29</a> bomber, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay">Enola Gay</a>, dropped &ldquo;Little Boy,&rdquo; the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon">atomic bomb</a> used in combat on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, killing tens of thousands and leveling the city. On August 9, the Soviet Union renounced its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact">non-aggression pact</a> with Japan and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria">attacked the Japanese in Manchuria</a>, fulfilling its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference">Yalta Conference</a> pledge to attack the Japanese within three months of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day">end of the war in Europe</a>. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups. On that same day, &ldquo;Fat Man,&rdquo; a second atomic bomb was dropped by the US on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>.</p>
<p>In less than two weeks the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Army">Kwantung Army</a>, which was the primary Japanese fighting force, consisting of over a million men but lacking adequate armor, artillery, or air support, had been destroyed by the Soviets. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan">Japanese Emperor</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito">Hirohito</a> officially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan">capitulated</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II">Allies</a> on August 15, 1945.</p>
<p>After the Allied victory in the Pacific, General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosa">Formosa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina">French Indochina</a> north of 16&deg; north latitude to surrender to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Resumption of Civil War</strong></h2>
<p>In 1945, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_%281912%E2%80%931949%29">China</a> emerged from the war nominally a great military power but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation">inflation</a>, and by corruption and mismanagement in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang">Nationalist</a> government that included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_profiteering">profiteering</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation">speculation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding">hoarding</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference">Yalta Conference</a>, which allowed for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence">sphere of influence</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">starvation</a> in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.</p>
<p>The problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and while the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China">Communists</a> both in popularity and as a viable fighting force in the north and northeast.</p>
<p>The Red Army, with strong grassroots support and its superior organization and morale, fostered the image of having conducted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">propaganda</a>, CCP membership grew from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.</p>
<p>Mao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. The Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Japanese army, quickly establish control in the countryside, and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCP acquired a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks, but it was not until large numbers of well-trained KMT troops surrendered and joined the communist forces that the CCP were finally able to master the hardware. Despite the disadvantage in military hardware, the CCP's ultimate trump card was its land reform policy. The CCP continued to make the irresistible promise in the countryside to the massive number of landless and starving Chinese peasants that by fighting for the CCP they would be able to take farmland from their landlords. This strategy enabled the CCP to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower to use in combat as well as provide logistic support, despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many civil war campaigns. For example, during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaihai_Campaign">Huaihai Campaign</a> alone the CCP were able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.</p>
<p>Using the pretext of "receiving the Japanese surrender," KMT officials occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>. They also recruited troops and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.</p>
<p>The US strongly supported the KMT. 50,000 Marines were sent to guard strategic sites, and 100,000 US troops were sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong">Shandong</a>. The US equipped and trained over 500,000 KMT troops, and transported KMT forces to occupy newly-liberated zones, and to contain Communist-controlled areas. American aid included substantial amounts of both new and surplus military supplies, and loans worth $4.43 billion from the US - most of which was military aid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on Communist territory with 113 brigades (1.6 million troops). This marked the final phase of the Chinese Civil War. Knowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CCP executed a "passive defense" strategy. They avoided the strong points of the KMT army, and were prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve their forces. In most cases, the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. They also attempted to wear down the KMT forces as much as possible. Three decisive Liaoshen, Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns effectively broke the back of the KMT army.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sep-Nov 1948 in the decisive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoshen_Campaign">Liaoshen Campaign</a> the CCP captured the northern cities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang">Shenyang</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changchun">Changchun</a> and seized control of all of Manchuria mainly by encirclement. The KMT lost its chief resources; the PLA went from numerical inferiority to superiority; the KMT was seriously demoralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nov 1948-Jan 1949 in the Huaihai Campaign, PLA took the area north of the Yangzi. Chiang committed his best-trained, best-equipped units to this campaign, but it was doomed by pervasive CCP spying in the ROC ranks. Spies not only leaked info to the PLA, and gave strategic disinformation to Chiang, but instigated massive defections to the PLA, and even caused a vendetta between ROC generals Huang Baitao and Qiu Qing-quan, the latter of whom withheld his units from combat in the decisive battle of Xubeng (Xuzhou) &ndash; both generals committed suicide in the defeat. The capture of large KMT formations provided the PLA with US-supplied tanks, heavy artillery, and other combined-arms. Truman lost faith in Chiang and cut off US aid. Furthermore Chiang was stripped of leadership of the KMT.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingjin_Campaign">Pingjin Campaign</a> resulting in the Communist conquest of northern China lasted 64 days from Nov 1948, to Jan 1949. The PLA suffered heavy casualties securing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiakou">Zhangjiakou</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">Tianjin</a> along with its port and garrison at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taku_Forts">Dagu</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beiping</a>. The CCP brought 890,000 troops from the Northeast to oppose some 600,000 KMT troops. There were 40,000 CCP casualties at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiakou">Zhangjiakou</a> alone. They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT during the campaign. After Lin Biao took Zhangjiakou, Xinbao&rsquo;an, Tianjin, and Beiping surrendered.</p>
<p>On 21 April, Communist forces crossed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River">Yangtze River</a>. On 23 April they captured the KMT's capital, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. The KMT government retreated to Canton (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>) until October 15, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing">Chongqing</a> until November 25, and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu">Chengdu</a> before retreating to Taiwan on December 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1949 Red Army victories led to the evacuation from the mainland to Taiwan by Chiang and the KMT, and the creation on 1 October, 1949, of the People's Republic of China (PRC) by the CCP on the mainland, with the Republic of China's (ROC) jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penghu">Penghu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinmen">Quemoy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsu_Islands">Matsu</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_the_Republic_of_China">several outlying islands</a>. While the PRC continued to call for the unification of all China, Chiang proclaimed Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC and asserted his government as the sole legitimate authority in China. Truman&rsquo;s Democratic administration was accused by Republicans of having &ldquo;lost&rdquo; China, and the US, until the 1970s, continued to recognize the ROC in Taiwan as the true government of China.</p>
<p>Chiang wrote in his diary in June 1948 that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of rot from within. Strong initial support from the US diminished, and then stopped completely partly because of KMT corruption, and partly because of the uncertain US foreign policy towards Communism between 1945 and 1950. Communist land reform policy, which promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords, ensured peasant support for the PLA.</p>

Following Japan&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan">surrender </a>in September 1945, American administrators divided the peninsula along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea">38th parallel</a>, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces">U.S. military forces</a> occupying the southern half and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_military">Soviet military forces</a> occupying the northern half. The failure to hold free elections throughout the Korean Peninsula in 1948 deepened the division between the two sides: by the end of the decade, a communist dictator enjoyed the support of the Soviets in the north, while in the south an anti-communist dictator was supported by the US government. Border skirmishes were common and nearly 10,000 soldiers were killed even before the Korean War began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time seemed right for a Communist reunification of Korea - the Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September 1949; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea; battle-hardened North Korean soldiers were returning from China&rsquo;s successful communist revolution, in which the US had not intervened; and Stalin calculated that the US was focused on Europe. So, in April 1950, Stalin gave Kim Il-sung the go-ahead to invade the South if Mao would agree to send reinforcements, if needed. Stalin made it clear, however, that Soviet forces would not directly engage in combat with the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some 75,000 soldiers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army">Korean People's Army</a> (KPA) crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire at dawn on Sunday 25 June 1950. On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman had dispatched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait">Taiwan Strait</a>, causing China to abort its planned invasion of Taiwan.&nbsp; By 28 June, Seoul had fallen. Suffering severe casualties within the first two months, South Korean forces were pushed back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusan_perimeter">Pusan perimeter</a>.</p>
<p>The US then took advantage of the absence of the USSR from the Security Council to propose that the UN enter the war on the side of the South. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> had walked out of the Security Council because the ROC and not the PRC was represented on the Council, and so was not present to veto the United States Security Council resolution authorizing military intervention on behalf of South Korea against the communist North.</p>
<p>In the US, the war was initially described by President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_action">police action</a>" as it was an undeclared military action, conducted under the auspices of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>. The US would provide 88% of the 341,000 international soldiers who aided South Korean forces, with twenty other countries of the United Nations offering assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Command of UN forces was given to Douglas Macanthur, a Republican who publicly decalred his intention to to push the war into China so as to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; that country from Communism, intending then return to a grateful country and run for President in 1952.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 September, 1950, a UN counter-offensive at Inchon (near Seoul) routed the North Koreans and drove them north of the 38th parallel and almost to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalu_River">Yalu River</a>, the border between North Korea and Communist China. Fearing Republican attacks that he was &ldquo;soft on Communism (after all he had just &ldquo;lost&rdquo; China),&nbsp; Truman gave MacArthur approval to proceed north of the 38th parallel. On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the U.S. that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel. On 1 October 1950, the first anniversary of the founding of the PRC, the ROK Army crossed into North Korea; Kim Il-sung was sending frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. From 2&ndash;5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea. Mao strongly supported intervention, and after Peng Dehuai citing MacArthur&rsquo;s boast that he would &ldquo;liberate China&rdquo; made the case that US troops would likely reach the Yalu (the border between Korea and China) and invade China, the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea. Meanwhile, on 7 October, with Truman&rsquo;s approval, US forces crossed the 38th parallel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island">Wake Island</a> in the mid-Pacific Ocean. This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental US. MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the north had lapsed. He believed the PRC had 100,000&ndash;125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River. He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, "if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter" without air force protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 25 October 200,000 Chinese troops entered North Korea. UN aerial recon had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivouac_shelter">bivouac</a> discipline minimized aerial detection. Marching only at night, the Chinese covered the 286 miles from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in 19 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese intervention forced the UN forces to retreat back to the 38th parallel. While not directly committing forces to the conflict, the Soviet Union provided material aid to both the North Korean and Chinese armies. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the armistice agreement was signed. The agreement restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a> (DMZ), a 2.5-mile-wide fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Mao Zedong decided to confront the US first because he believed that such a military conflict was inevitable after the US entered the Korean War and second to improve his own prestige in the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. Within the PRC, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, and allowed the CCP to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent. The Chinese war effort is considered an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years. Mao had also discovered the usefulness of large-scale <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_movement">mass movements</a> in the war while implementing them among most of his ruling measures over PRC. Finally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism">anti-American sentiments</a>, which were already a significant factor during the Chinese Civil War, became ingrained into CCP culture during the Communist propaganda campaigns of the Korean War. The only significant negative consequence of the war for the PRC was that it led the US to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Hundred Flowers</strong> <strong>百花運動</strong><strong> (1957)</strong></h2>
<p>In October 1949 the CCP proclaimed the establishment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China">PRC</a>. Mao felt the best way to finance industrialization was for the government to take control of agriculture, thereby establishing a monopoly over grain distribution and supply. This would allow the state to buy at a low price and sell much higher, thus raising the capital necessary for the industrialization of the country. In 1954, peasants were encouraged to form and join collectives, which would supposedly increase efficiency without robbing them of their land or restricting their livelihoods. Internal passports (called the 戶口<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system"><em>hukou</em></a> system) were introduced in 1956, forbidding travel without appropriate authorization. One&rsquo;s allotment of rice was available only through one&rsquo;s <em>hukou</em>. Highest priority was given to the urban <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat">proletariat</a> for whom a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state">welfare state</a> was created.</p>
<p>In 1957 Mao responded to tensions in the Party by promoting free speech and criticism during the Hundred Flowers Campaign (&ldquo;Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools contend.&rdquo;). Asked repeatedly to give their honest assessment of Party policies, and promised freedom from reprisal, many Party cadres did so, but were more critical than Mao had expected. Stung by criticism, Mao went back on his word and purged at least half a million people in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Movement">Anti-Rightist campaign</a>, which effectively silenced any opposition from within the Party to Mao&rsquo;s plans. There is still debate over whether Mao was sincere initially.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Great Leap Forward 大躍進</strong><strong> (1958)</strong></h2>
<p>The Great Leap itself was an <em>ad hoc</em> cluster of policies that emerged in 1958 due to three factors: initially pragmatic adaptations of work schedules, Mao&rsquo;s increasing dislike of Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the USSR, and overly enthusiastic local Party cadres. The movement spun out of control, however, due to irrational exuberance and resulted in the greatest disaster in human history &ndash; the deaths of some 30 million people.</p>
<p><strong>Distrust of Khrushchev</strong></p>
<p>Mao was suspicious of Khrushchev first of all for the latter&rsquo;s Secret Speech of 1956 in which he exposed the crimes of Joseph Stalin and attacked the cult of personality, which Mao was then cultivating; then for his doctrine of peaceful coexistence with the West, which Mao found revisionist; then for his invasion of Hungary during that country&rsquo;s democracy demonstrations without consulting the larger Socialist sphere, meaning China; and finally for not sharing the atom bomb with his socialist brother (Mao). Khrushchev&rsquo;s and Stalin&rsquo;s refusal to give the bomb to Mao arose from their suspicion that he would not hesitate to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Communes&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the winter of 1957-58, China sought to mobilize idle peasants to construct major water conservancy projects like dams, reservoirs, and dykes. Mao did not employ engineers, whom he characterized as useless, impractical bookworms, in the design or construction of these projects. He trusted instead in the socialist enthusiasm of the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; peasants, who could achieve great things, once freed from the bourgeois intelligentsia. As a corollary to the men being tied up working on the water conservancy projects, women were &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; to work in the fields. More and more of their household tasks were then collectivized until these collective groups grew into massive communes, which were hailed as the first sprouts of Communism. In the summer of 1958 Mao visited the commune in Henan named &ldquo;Sputnik&rdquo; (after the satellite the USSR put into orbit in October 1957, shocking the US) and proclaimed &ldquo;人民公社好! (Communes are good!)&rdquo; Soon every cadre in China was rushing to equal the performance of &ldquo;Sputnik.&rdquo; Private plots were taken away from peasants and local markets closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crop experiments</strong></p>
<p>On the communes, a number of radical and controversial agricultural innovations were promoted at the behest of Mao. Many of these were based on the ideas of now discredited Soviet agronomist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko">Trofim Lysenko</a>. The policies included close-cropping, whereby seeds were sown far more densely than normal on the incorrect assumption that seeds of the same class would not compete with each other, and deep-plowing (up to 6 feet), based upon the mistaken belief that this would yield plants with extra large root systems. Moderately productive land was left unplanted in the belief that concentrating manure and effort on the most fertile land would lead to larger per-acre productivity gains. To allay peasants&rsquo; fears of these new methods, a photo in the People&rsquo;s Daily showed children lying on top of rice sprouts supposedly grown according to these principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Great Sparrow Campaign</strong></p>
<p>There was also a &ldquo;People&rsquo;s War&rdquo; against crop-eating pests, especially sparrows. The peasants who killed the most sparrows by chasing them until they dropped from exhaustion were praised as model citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Party Reaction</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, local leaders were pressured into falsely reporting ever-higher grain production figures to their political superiors. Participants at political meetings remembered production figures being inflated up to 10 times actual production amounts as the race to please superiors and win plaudits &ndash; like the chance to meet Mao himself &ndash; intensified. The state was later able to force many production groups to sell more grain than they could spare based on these false production figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Backyard Furnaces</strong></p>
<p>Knowing nothing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and despising educated engineers, Mao encouraged the establishment of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_furnace">backyard steel furnaces</a> in every commune and urban neighborhood. Mao was shown an example of a backyard furnace in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei">Hefei</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui">Anhui</a> in September 1958, which was said to be manufacturing high quality steel.</p>
<p>Huge efforts on the part of peasants and other workers were made to produce steel out of scrap metal. To fuel the furnaces the local environment was denuded of trees and wood taken from the doors and furniture of peasants' houses. Pots, pans, and other metal artifacts were requisitioned to supply the "scrap" for the furnaces so that the wildly optimistic production targets could be met.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Early Results</strong></p>
<p>Mao had proclaimed that China would surpass Britain in steel production in 15 years, but when steel production showed a 30% increase in 1958, Mao declared it would take only 3 years for China to surpass Britain! Villages competed to emulate &ldquo;Sputnik&rdquo; as local cadres increased quotas for grain shipments. Buoyed by these enthusiastic estimates of grain production, Mao was elated and thought he could leap-frog the Soviet Union and beat them to the promised land of Communism through his style of peasant mobilization. Mao then encouraged peasants to have more children and eat not three, but five meals a day! On communes, peasants would receive food according to the socialist ideal of &ldquo;to each according to his need.&rdquo; Work points counted for only 30% of one&rsquo;s allotment. Mao gloried in his &ldquo;victory&rdquo; over Khrushchev. China was caught up in a national euphoria.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Then, awakening from Mao&rsquo;s Socialist fantasy, China faced the morning after.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crop Yields</strong></p>
<p>The weather in 1958 was very favorable and the harvest should have been good. Unfortunately, deep-plowing and close-planting didn&rsquo;t actually work (the photo in the People&rsquo;s Daily had been doctored), and the amount of labor diverted to steel production and construction projects meant that much of the harvest was left to rot uncollected in some areas. This problem was exacerbated by a devastating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust">locust</a> swarm, caused when the locusts&rsquo; natural predators were killed as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sparrow_Campaign">Great Sparrow Campaign</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Backyard Steel</strong></p>
<p>The backyard steel was so impure that it snapped under pressure. The output of these furnaces consisted of low quality lumps of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_iron">pig iron</a> which was of negligible economic worth. During a visit to a traditional steel works in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria">Manchuria</a> in January 1959, Mao learned for himself that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.</p>
<p><strong>Water Conservancy</strong></p>
<p>Most of the dams built by peasant know-how collapsed under the strain of winter rains &ndash; one that collapsed in 1975 killed 200,000 people. Shortages of fuel and severe erosion resulted from deforestation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Starvation</strong></p>
<p>Although actual harvests were reduced, local officials, under tremendous pressure from central authorities to report record harvests in response to the innovations, competed with each other to announce increasingly exaggerated results. These were used as a basis for determining the amount of grain to be taken by the State to supply the towns and cities, and to export. This left barely enough for the peasants, and in some areas, starvation set in. By&nbsp; early 1961, an estimated 30 million had starved to death. Stories still circulate of peasants eating tree bark or clay, or even of cannibalism, whereby peasants would starve one of their children, then trade with another family, who would make a soup of the emaciated body.</p>
<p><strong>Party Reaction</strong></p>
<p>Local cadres still had increasing quotas to fill. Some Party officials who saw the suffering of the peasants committed suicide, or were replaced by cadres who had no such qualms. Authorities even ordered that statistics be destroyed in regions where population decline became evident. Mao refused to open the state granaries as he dismissed reports of food shortages and accused rich peasants of hiding grain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During 1958&ndash;1960 China continued to be a substantial net exporter of grain, despite the widespread starvation in the countryside, as Mao sought to maintain face and convince the outside world of the success of his vision. Foreign aid was refused. When the Japanese foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart Chen Yi of an offer of 100,000 tons of wheat to be shipped out of public view, he was rebuffed. Even as the peasants didn&rsquo;t have enough to eat, grain was sent to the industrial centers and even exported to the Soviet Union to repay a 1949 loan from Stalin. China&rsquo;s net grain exports in 1959 and 1960 would have been enough to feed 16 million people 2000 calories per day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Lushan Conference</strong></p>
<p>In July 1959 at the Lushan Conference, Defense Minister Peng Dehuai confronted Mao with the situation in the countryside, but no one backed him up. Mao replaced Peng with the more pliant Lin Biao, accused Peng of sabotaging socialism and put him under house arrest. As to the famine, Mao refused to budge. He could not admit failure and no one dared to question his judgment. Mao blamed rich peasants and bad weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Ninth Plenum</strong></p>
<p>The agricultural policies of the Great Leap Forward and the associated famine continued until January 1961, when, at the Ninth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Mao finally relented and allowed Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping to institute their emergency policies of reducing the communes, restoring individual plots, reopening markets, allowing sideline occupations, and making households responsible for meeting their quota, after which they could keep the surplus. Grain exports were stopped, and imports from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> helped to reduce the impact of the food shortages, at least in the coastal cities. The exact number of famine deaths is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18 to 42 million people, the deadliest famine in the history of the world. Economic recovery began immediately, but the Party&rsquo;s credibility had been shattered.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (</strong><strong>文革</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>was launched in May 1966. Mao alleged that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois">bourgeois</a> elements were infiltrating the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. Millions of people were persecuted in the violent factional struggles that ensued across the country, and suffered a wide range of abuses including public humiliation, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, sustained harassment, and seizure of property. A large segment of the population was forcibly displaced, most notably the transfer of urban youth to rural regions during the &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement">Down to the Countryside Movement</a>.&rsquo; Historical relics and artifacts were destroyed. Cultural and religious sites were ransacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Precursor</strong></p>
<p>In late 1959, historian and Beijing Deputy Mayor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Han_%28PRC%29">Wu Han</a> published a historical drama entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Rui_Dismissed_from_Office"><em>Hai Rui Dismissed from Office</em></a> (海瑞罷官). In the play, an honest civil servant, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Rui">Hai Rui</a>, is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. Mao initially praised the play, but in February 1965 his wife alleged that <em>Hai Rui</em> was really an allegory attacking Mao, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Dehuai">Peng Dehuai</a> as the honest civil servant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December, Defense Minister and Mao loyalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao">Lin Biao</a> accused General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luo_Ruiqing">Luo Ruiqing</a>, the chief of staff of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army">People's Liberation Army</a> (PLA), of being anti-Mao, alleging that Luo put too much emphasis on military training rather than Maoist "political discussion." Luo was denounced, dismissed, and forced to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism">self-criticism</a>. Luo's removal secured the military command's loyalty to Mao.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>May 16 Notification</strong></p>
<p>On May 16, 1966 the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Wu Han and his "anti-party allies" in the strongest terms, and declaring that the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" had been launched. It states in part: &ldquo;Those representatives of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> who have snuck into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a> into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev">Khrushchev</a> for example, who are still nestling beside us. Party committees at all levels must pay full attention to this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Early mass rallies</strong></p>
<p>On May 25, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nie_Yuanzi">Nie Yuanzi</a>, a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-character_poster">big-character poster</a> (大字報) along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie insinuated that the university leadership was trying to contain revolutionary fervor in a "sinister" attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism. Mao, favoring chaos as a means to "cleanse" the leadership ranks, ordered Nie's message to be broadcast nationwide and called it "the first Marxist big-character poster in China." Classes were cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on June 13 to expand the class suspension nationwide. By early June, throngs of radicalized students, Red Guards (紅衛兵), lined the capital's major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans against his perceived enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the auspices of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, work teams - effectively 'ideological-guidance' squads of cadres - were sent to the city's schools and <em>People's Daily</em> to restore some semblance of order. However, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 28, Red Guard representatives wrote to Mao, stating that mass purges and all such related social and political phenomena were justified and correct. Mao responded with his full support with his own big-character poster entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombard_the_Headquarters"><em>Bombard the Headquarters</em></a> (炮打司令部). Mao wrote that despite having undergone a Communist revolution, China's political hierarchy was still dominated by "bourgeois" elitist elements, capitalists, and revisionists, and that these counter-revolutionary elements were indeed still present at the top ranks of the party leadership itself. This was, in effect, an open call-to-arms against Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and their allies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"</strong></p>
<p>On August 8, 1966, the party's Central Committee endorsed the Cultural Revolution: &ldquo;At present, our objective is to struggle against and crush those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic &lsquo;authorities&rsquo; and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art, and all other parts of the superstructure that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Decision called on not only students but also "the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres" to carry out the task of "transforming the superstructure" by writing big-character posters and holding "great debates."</p>
<p>On August 18, 1966, millions of Red Guards from all over the country gathered in Beijing for an audience with the Chairman. Atop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Gate">Tiananmen Gate</a>, Mao and Lin Biao made frequent appearances to greet approximately 11&nbsp;million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All politicians who had any history of being anything other than dogmatically Maoist were immediately purged. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a>, once the most powerful man in China after Mao, was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969, alone and naked and denied treatment for his diabetes. Deng Xiaoping was himself sent away for a period of re-education three times, until he was rehabilitated in 1973 by Zhou Enlai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a notice to stop "all police intervention in Red Guard tactics and actions." Those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled "counter-revolutionaries." Mao's praise for rebellion was effectively an endorsement for the actions of the Red Guards, who grew increasingly violent. Public security in China deteriorated rapidly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1967</strong></p>
<p>In February, Jiang Qing and Lin Biao, with support from Mao, insisted that the "class struggle" be extended to the military. Generals who expressed objections were all eventually purged. At the same time, many large and prominent Red Guard organizations rose in protest against other Red Guard organizations who ran dissimilar revolutionary messages, further complicating the situation and exacerbating the chaos. The only way to survive was to be more &ldquo;red&rdquo; than the others.</p>
<p>On July 22, Jiang Qing directed the Red Guards to replace the PLA if necessary, and thereby to render the existing forces powerless. After the initial praise by Jiang Qing, the Red Guards began to steal and loot from barracks and other army buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1968</strong></p>
<p>As Red Guard units got hold of PLA weapons, their conflicts turned into open warfare. Mao summoned Red Guard leaders to Beijing to impose order. When his instructions were ignored, Mao finally sent in the PLA on July 27, 1968, to restore order. In October, Lin Biao was made the Party's Vice-Chairman, Mao's "comrade-in-arms" and "designated successor," second only to Mao. In December, the Red Guard factions were sent down to the countryside, ostensibly to learn from the peasants, but actually to dismantle this weapon of struggle that had outlived its usefulness. They were sent on a one-way trip by their beloved leader, taking their <em>hukou</em> with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLA gains pre-eminent role</strong></p>
<p>The friction with the Soviet Union intensified after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict">border clashes</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussuri_River">Ussuri River</a> in March 1969 as the Chinese leadership prepared for all-out war. In October, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing. The prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing the stature of Lin Biao at the expense of Mao. Lin&rsquo;s supporters further urged the restoration of the position of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">State Chairman</a>, which had been abolished after the purge of Liu Shaoqi. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, his succession would be institutionalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flight of Lin Biao</strong></p>
<p>By 1971, Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence. Sensing the threat to his power base and Mao&rsquo;s declining health, Lin plotted to oust Mao in a coup, dubbed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_571_Outline"><em>Outline for Project 571</em></a> (武起義). Lin had planned to bomb a bridge that Mao was to cross to reach Beijing, but Mao got wind of the plot and avoided this bridge. On September 13, 1971, Lin fled by plane to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> ostensibly to seek asylum. En route, Lin's plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, killing all on board. A Soviet team investigating the incident hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.</p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; </strong><strong>(四人幫)</strong><strong> and their downfall</strong></p>
<p>In September 1972, Mao transferred a thirty-eight year-old cadre from Shanghai, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Hongwen">Wang Hongwen</a>, to Beijing and made him Vice-Chairman of the Party. Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background, was seemingly being groomed for succession. Jiang Qing's position also strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, it was clear that Jiang Qing had political ambitions of her own. She allied herself with Wang Hongwen and propaganda specialists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chunqiao">Zhang Chunqiao</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Wenyuan">Yao Wenyuan</a>, to form a political clique later pejoratively dubbed the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four">Gang of Four</a>."</p>
<p><strong>The Gang target Zhou Enlai</strong></p>
<p>By 1973, the party's core had once again become dominated by leftist radicals, whose focus remained upholding ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained largely the domain of Zhou Enlai, one of the few moderates left standing. Zhou attempted to restore a viable economy, but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their main political threat in post-Mao era succession.</p>
<p>In late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's betrayal, Jiang Qing and the Gang began the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticize_Lin,_Criticize_Confucius">Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius</a>" (批孔批林) campaign. Its stated goals were to purge China of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Confucianism">new Confucianist</a> thinking and denounce Lin Biao's actions as traitorous and regressive. Reminiscent of the first years of the Cultural Revolution, the battle was carried out through historical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory">allegory</a>, and although Zhou Enlai's name was never mentioned during this campaign, the Premier's historical namesake, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Zhou">Duke of Zhou</a>, was a frequent target.</p>
<p>With a fragile economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military. The speed of Deng's rehabilitation took the radical camp, who saw themselves as Mao's 'rightful' political and ideological heirs, by surprise. Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress any remaining influence of those formerly loyal to Lin Biao. In addition, Mao had become disenchanted with the Gang of Four's inability to manage the economy and saw Deng as a competent and effective leader. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would besmirch the positive legacy of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.</p>
<p>At the time, Jiang Qing and associates still held effective control of mass media and the party's propaganda network, though Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control however, did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity as the first step to restoring economic productivity. Much like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, and other key areas of the economy. By late 1975 however, Mao feared that Deng's economic restructuring might vitiate the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and launched a campaign to oppose "rehabilitating the case for the rightists," alluding to Deng as the country's foremost "rightist." Mao directed Deng to write a self-criticism, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Death of Zhou Enlai</strong></p>
<p>On January 8, 1976, Zhou Enlai died of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer">bladder cancer</a>. Curiously, after Zhou's death, Mao selected neither a member of the Gang of Four nor Deng Xiaoping to become Premier, instead choosing the harmless bureaucrat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Guofeng">Hua Guofeng</a>.</p>
<p>The Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions known as the "five nos": no wearing black armbands, no mourning wreaths, no mourning halls, no memorial activities, and no handing out photos of Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (who was seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against publicly mourning Zhou became associated with each other shortly after Zhou's death, leading to popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tiananmen Incident</strong></p>
<p>On April 4, 1976, on the eve of China's annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival">Qingming Festival</a> (清明節), a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_People%27s_Heroes">Monument to the People's Heroes</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square">Tiananmen Square</a> to commemorate Zhou Enlai by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument. The Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labeled the event 'counter-revolutionary,' and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Jiang Qing and her allies pinned Deng Xiaoping as the incident's 'mastermind,' and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions "inside and outside the Party" on April 7. This marked Deng's second purge in ten years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Death of Mao and Arrest of the Gang of Four</strong></p>
<p>On September 9, 1976, Mao Zedong died. Shortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message "With you in charge, I'm at ease," to Hua Guofeng. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang's radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and a large segment of party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Jianying">Ye Jianying</a>, on October 10, Hua had all the members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Deng Xiaoping&rsquo;s Reforms</strong><strong> (1979)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>A new page in diplomacy</strong></p>
<p>Relations with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc">the West</a> improved markedly during Deng's term. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations">The PRC had joined the UN</a> in 1971, replacing the ROC. In February 1972, US President Richard Nixon had made an unprecedented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_visit_to_China_1972">eight-day visit</a> to the People's Republic of China and met with Mao Zedong. On February 22, 1973, the US and PRC agreed to establish liaison offices. Although both sides intended to establish diplomatic relations quickly, this move was delayed until 1979 due to the Watergate scandal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Gang&rsquo;s Fall</strong></p>
<p>Mao Zedong died on September 9, 1976. At his death, China was in a political and economic quagmire. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural</a> Revolution and subsequent factional fighting had left the country much poorer, weaker, and isolated than it had been in 1965. Scores of capable party officials, bureaucrats, intellectuals, and professionals were languishing in prison or laboring in factories, mines, and fields. Many schools had been closed, and an entire generation of young people was left without an education.</p>
<p>Mao&rsquo;s designated successor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Guofeng">Hua Guofeng</a> had assumed the post of party chairman, but was unaware that the Gang of Four were plotting his downfall until Defense Minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Jianying">Ye Jianying</a> and several generals warned him about this, saying that he'd better do something before it was too late. Hua was surprised, but he agreed, and in October 1976 the Gang were arrested. None of them put up any resistance, although one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing">Jiang Qing</a>'s housekeepers reportedly spat at her as she was being taken away. The demise and arrest of the Gang of Four prompted nationwide celebrations, including parades in the streets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a> and other major cities. The Gang of Four symbolized everything that had gone wrong during the ten years of chaos of the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p><strong>The Two Whatevers</strong></p>
<p>In late 1976 and early 1977, the state propaganda machine was working overtime to promote Hua Guofeng. He was billed as being Mao's personally appointed successor and as having saved China from the Gang of Four. Hua tried to fill his mentor's shoes by, among other things, sporting an identical haircut. He stated that "in order to honor Chairman Mao, we should govern in accordance with his wishes." and proclaimed the &ldquo;Two Whatevers,&rdquo; meaning that "Whatever Chairman Mao said, we will say, and whatever Chairman Mao did, we will do." Throughout 1977&ndash;1978, policy efforts centered on economic recovery. Schools began to reopen, and the more extreme aspects of Mao's personality cult were toned down. At the time Deng Xiaoping was still living in seclusion because of "political mistakes," and the issue of his return to politics was yet again considered. Though Hua attempted to keep Deng on ice, in July 1977, Deng was restored in his former posts</p>
<p><strong>Deng becomes Paramount Leader</strong></p>
<p>Although Hua continued in his leadership role, his power began waning the moment Deng returned to Beijing. Hua was widely seen as being nothing more than a vacuous party hack with no ideas of his own, as reflected in the 1978 constitution, which still contained references to proletarian internationalism and continuous revolution. Deng restored the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao">University Entrance Examinations</a>, and opened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-secondary_education">post-secondary education</a> to nearly a generation deprived of this opportunity by Cultural Revolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deng chaired the 11th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China">National Congress of the Communist Party of China</a>, China's <em>de jure</em> legislative body, and stressed the importance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Modernizations">Four Modernizations</a>: expanding rural income and incentives, encouraging experiments in enterprise autonomy, reducing central planning, and establishing direct foreign investment in Mainland China. By then Deng was poised to make a final move to gain political power, and Deng's novel and pragmatic stance gained increasing popularity. In late 1978, many emboldened people began staging rallies and protests in Beijing. They erected a large number of wall posters (the so-called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Wall">Democracy Wall</a>") criticizing the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong, the Gang of Four, and Hua Guofeng. All these were tolerated because of being more-or-less in line with official positions. Those calling for democracy and open elections were answered by authorities who stressed that the Party would continue to hold power and guide the nation towards socialism. Nonetheless, writers began criticizing corruption, privileges enjoyed by Party officials, and unemployment, all things that supposedly could not exist under socialism.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Reform and Opening up</strong></p>
<p>The new, pragmatic leadership emphasized economic development and renounced mass political movements. At the pivotal Third Plenum, opened on 22 December 1978, the leadership adopted Deng&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Modernizations">Four Modernizations</a>. The strategy for achieving these aims, all of which were designed to help China become a modern, industrial nation, was "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics">socialism with Chinese characteristics</a>". It opened a new era in Chinese history known as "Reforms and Opening up"(改革开放) to the Outside World. The Plenum also decided to accelerate the pace of legal reform, culminating in the passage of several new legal codes by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_People%27s_Congress">National People's Congress</a> in June 1979.</p>
<p>However, these changes were not managed without overcoming opposition in the party, bureaucracy, and military. There were still a few extremist followers of the Gang of Four, though not many, and efforts were made to weed them from the party. There did exist a large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism">Stalinists</a> who believed in orthodox central planning, and socio-political conformity. This group generally wanted to return to the ways of the 1950s and restore ties with the Soviet Union, believing that the communist world was China's natural friend. In particular, many of the Stalinists thought that Deng Xiaoping went too far in dismantling Mao's legacy and allowing greater freedom of expression. Many of them were in the military, and complained about having its budget cut from 10% of China's total GDP in 1978 to 5% by 1982. Several weapons projects that had been in the works during the '70s were dropped due to being too expensive and unnecessary. Generals also objected to being asked to produce consumer goods instead of receiving badly needed defense modernization. Deng stressed the need for military obedience to Party directives. A higher degree of professionalism was emphasized in the PLA during the 1980s and the system of ranks that had been abolished in 1965 was gradually restored. On National Day (October 1) 1984, China would stage its first military parade since 1959, though it would show that China&rsquo;s armed forces were 25 years behind the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong>Local Initiative</strong></p>
<p>Although Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself. Local leaders, often in violation of central government directives, introduced many reforms. If successful, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas, and ultimately introduced nationally. Many other reforms were imported from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_Tigers">East Asian Tigers</a> (Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea). This methodology was in sharp contrast to the economic restructuring, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika"><em>perestroika</em></a>, undertaken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> in the USSR, in which Gorbachev himself originated most of the major reforms. Many economists have argued that the bottom-up approach of Deng's reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of Perestroika, was a key factor in China&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>At the local level, material incentives rather than political appeals were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots on the free market. In the main move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng's reforms induced China's development strategy to emphasize light industry and export-led growth. The revenues that the light-manufacturing sector generated could be reinvested in more technologically advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments. However, these investments were not government-mandated, in sharp contrast to the similar but much less successful reforms in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary">Hungary</a>. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. Deng also attracted foreign companies to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Economic_Zones_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">Special Economic Zones</a>, where capitalist business practices were encouraged.</p>
<p>Another important focus of the reforms was the need to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization, and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979</strong></p>
<p>China's relations with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Vietnam">Socialist Republic of Vietnam</a> began to deteriorate seriously in the mid-1970s. After Vietnam joined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet</a>-dominated Council for Mutual Economic Cooperation and signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1978, China branded Vietnam the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba</a> of the East" and called the treaty a military alliance. Incidents along the Sino-Vietnamese border increased in frequency and violence. In December 1978 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian-Vietnamese_War">Vietnam invaded Cambodia</a>, quickly ousted the pro-Maoist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a> regime (perpetrators of the killing fields), and overran the country. China also decried mistreatment of ethnic Chinese living in Vietnam, hegemonistic "imperial dreams" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and spurning of Beijing's attempt to repatriate Chinese residents of Vietnam to China.</p>
<p>In February 1979 China attacked along virtually the entire Sino-Vietnamese border in a brief, limited campaign. The Chinese attack came at dawn on the morning of 17 February 1979, and employed infantry, armor, and artillery. Within a day, the PLA had advanced some eight kilometers into Vietnam along a broad front. It then slowed and nearly stalled because of heavy Vietnamese resistance and difficulties within the Chinese supply system. On February 21, the advance resumed against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Bang">Cao Bang</a> in the far north and against the all-important regional hub of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Son">Lang Son</a>. Chinese troops entered Cao Bang on February 27, but the city was not secured completely until March 2. Lang Son fell two days later. On March 5, the Chinese, saying Vietnam had been sufficiently chastised, announced that the campaign was over. Beijing declared its "lesson" finished and the PLA withdrawal was completed on March 16.</p>
<p><strong>Denouement of the Gang of Four</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Gang of Four went on trial in 1980 on charges of counter-revolution, attempting to overthrow the state, and plotting to assassinate Mao. Only Jiang Qing tried to defend herself, repeatedly interrupting the proceedings with hysterical outbursts and sobbing. She argued that she had never done anything more than follow Mao's orders, saying "I was his dog. Whoever he told me to bite, I bit." and daring the authorities to cut off her head. The others were given life in prison, but Jiang was sentenced to death later commuted to life. She hanged herself in a Beijing hospital in 1991 while undergoing treatment for throat cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Hua Guofeng Replaced&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hua was replaced by Zhao Ziyang as Premier of the State Council in September 1980, and by Hu Yaobang as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPC_General_Secretary">CPC General Secretary</a> of the party in September 1982. The post of Chairman was abolished to ensure that no one person could ever dominate the party as Mao Zedong had done. Until the mid-1990s, Deng Xiaoping was China's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"><em>de facto</em></a> leader, retaining only the official title of Chairman of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Military_Commission">Central Military Commission</a>. Deng's intention was to have power divided, thus preventing a cult of personality from forming as it did in the case of Mao. The new emphasis on procedure, however, seemed largely undermined by Deng himself, who held power, yet assumed none of the official titles on the grounds that they should go to younger men.</p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong&rsquo;s Repatriation</strong></p>
<p>One of Deng's achievements was the agreement signed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the PRC on December 19, 1984 under which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> was to be transferred to the PRC in 1997. With the 99-year lease on the New Territories coming to an end, Deng agreed that the PRC would not interfere with Hong Kong's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalist</a> system and would allow the locals a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years. This "one country, two systems" approach has been touted by the PRC government as a potential framework within which Taiwan could be reunited with the mainland. Deng, however, did not improve relations with the Soviet Union. He continued to adhere to the Maoist line of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Split">Sino-Soviet Split</a> era, which stated that the Soviet Union was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower">superpower</a> as "hegemonistic" as the US, yet closer.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Tiananmen Square Protests</strong><strong> (1989)</strong></h2>
<p>In the 1980&rsquo;s, political dissent over social problems, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation">inflation</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption">political corruption</a>, massive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization">urban migration</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution">prostitution</a> emerged. The time period between 1982&ndash;89 saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press">freedom of the press</a> like never before, and never yet again. Students and intellectuals urged greater economic and political reforms, while revolutionary party elders became increasingly skeptical of the pace and the ultimate goals of the reform program, as it deviated from the intended direction of the CCP.</p>
<p>In late 1983, there had been a brief revival of the Cultural Revolution when the "Anti-Spiritual Pollution" campaign was launched, during which pornography and unacceptable writings were confiscated, and people with Western hairstyles were forced to cut their hair. Also during the 1980s, religious freedom was restored in China. The state recognized five official faiths, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism">Taoism</a>. Houses of worship were permitted to operate with a license and under the condition that they not oppose the party or socialism. This religious settlement has led to certain anomalies, such as a Catholic bishop sent from Rome leading one congregation, and a bishop recognized by Beijing leading another.</p>
<p>In December 1986, student demonstrators, taking advantage of the loosening political controls, staged protests against the slow pace of reform, confirming party elders' fears that the current reform program was leading to social instability. Inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_Lizhi">Fang Lizhi</a>, a physicist from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China">University of Science and Technology of China</a> who gave speeches criticizing Deng's go-slow policies, students began to call for campus elections, the chance to study abroad, and greater availability of western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_culture">pop culture</a>. Hu Yaobang, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Deng and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP General Secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti-Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign," Hu was further denounced. Premier Zhao Ziyang was made General Secretary and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Peng">Li Peng</a>, a staunch conservative who was unpopular with the masses, was made Premier.</p>
<p>Then Zhao&rsquo;s economic and political reforms came under increasing attack from his conservative colleagues. His proposal in May 1988 to accelerate price reform led to widespread popular complaints of rampant inflation and gave opponents of rapid reform the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death of Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989, coupled with growing economic hardship caused by high inflation and other social factors, provided the backdrop for a large-scale protest movement by students, intellectuals, and other elements of the disaffected urban population. University students and other citizens in Beijing camped out at Tiananmen Square to mourn Hu's death and to protest against those who would slow reform. Their protests called for an end to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption">official corruption</a> and for the defense of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the PRC. The protests spread to other cities, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu">Chengdu</a>.</p>
<p>On April 26, the central leadership, under Deng Xiaoping, denounced all recent actions of protest as a form of "turmoil." Premier Li Peng was able, in cooperation with Deng, then-head of the Central Military Commission, to declare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law">martial law</a> in Beijing and order a military crackdown on the protests, even though this was in direct opposition to the wishes of the Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and other members of the Politburo. On May 4, many demonstrators recalled the slogans of the May Fourth Movement and bemoaned the fact that whereas Mr. Science had been made welcome, Mr. Deomcracy had not. On May 15, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who had introduced democratic reforms in the Soviet Union, visited China. His visit caused widespread calls for democracy in China as well. On May 18, Li Peng met with the leader of the student hunger-strikers, Wuer Kaixi. The next day Zhao Ziyang, in a conciliatory gesture went to the square and delivered by bullhorn a speech that was to be his last. Martial law was declared on May 20, 1989. Local militia units were sent into the streets, but tended to sympathize with rather than attack the students. As demonstrators mounted tanks and posters called for the overthrow of the CCP, leaders in Beijing began to panic. Late on June 3 and early on the morning of June 4, military units from Inner Mongolia, where there was no sympathy, as there had been among the local militia, for the &ldquo;bourgeois elements&rdquo; were brought into Beijing. Armed force was used to clear demonstrators from the square. PRC estimates place the number of deaths at between two to three hundred, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross">Red Cross</a> believes the number to be in the two to three thousand range.</p>
<p>After the protests, the Chinese government faced bitter criticism from the US for the suppression of the protests, which had been covered live on US TV. The government detained large numbers of protesters, and required political re-education not only for students but also for party cadres and government officials. Zhao Ziyang was placed under house arrest until his death 16 years later.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> formally retired after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">Tiananmen Square protests</a> and was succeeded by former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> mayor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>. Deng's idea of checks and balances in the political system also saw its demise as Jiang consolidated power in the party, state and military.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests, China became an international pariah and the next three years were grim. Hardliners took over the government and began reining in free enterprise. CCP leadership was further dismayed by the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989-1990. Despite its political repression, though, China still welcomed foreign business and investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1992, Deng Xiaoping suddenly reappeared in public and embarked on his famed Southern Tour of China to restore faith in his economic reforms and stop the country's slide back into Maoism. The visit was not only Deng's last major public appearance, but also seen as a test of the direction of the new leadership. Deng's renewed push for a market-oriented economy received official sanction at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Party_Congress">14th Party Congress</a> later in the year as a number of younger, reform-minded leaders began their rise to top positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deng's legacy</strong></p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping's policies opened up the economy to foreign investment and market allocation within a socialist framework, and put into practice a daring and unprecedented system that allowed free enterprise and capitalist ideas to grow under a single-party political system. Since his death, China has sustained an average of 8% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> growth annually and become the world's fastest growing major economy. Also, due in part to "socialist" measures and price/currency controls, the inflation of the years leading up to the Tiananmen protests subsided.</p>
<p>It became obvious by the mid-1990s that many state-owned enterprises were unprofitable and needed to be privatized to prevent them from being a permanent and unsustainable drain on the economy. As the pace of urbanization continued to increase, urban <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment">unemployment</a> became a serious problem, and urban housing shortages caused the rise of low-income <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slum">slums</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Deng's policy of asserting the primacy of economic development, while maintaining the rule of the Communist Party, raised questions as to the degree to which a one-party system can indefinitely maintain control over an increasingly dynamic and prosperous society. Questions have also been raised about the amount of foreign enterprise within China, and the time it takes before the government will no longer be able to control private enterprise.</p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping died on February 19, 1997. His ideology, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping_Theory">Deng Xiaoping Theory</a>, was elevated to the status of "guiding ideology" in the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Return of Hong Kong and Macau</strong></p>
<p>On July 1, 1997, at the expiration of Britain&rsquo;s 99-year lease, Hong Kong was returned to PRC control, by applying Deng's theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Country,_Two_Systems">One Country, Two Systems</a>: Hong Kong was to maintain independence in all areas except for foreign affairs and defense, without major changes for fifty years. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau">Macau</a> reverted to Chinese control under a similar agreement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</a> on December 20, 1999. The two former colonies kept their legal systems. Some debate ensued over the legitimacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Chief_Executive">Hong Kong Chief Executive</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chee-hwa">Tung Chee-hwa</a> and the level of democracy in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is also competing with Shanghai to remain the regional finance hub.</p>
<p><strong>Third generation of leaders</strong></p>
<p>Deng's health deteriorated in the years prior to his death in 1997. During that time, the "third generation" leadership governed collectively with Jiang as the "core." Jiang recentralized leadership by 1998 by ousting conservative faction leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiao_Shi">Qiao Shi</a> and becoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader">paramount leader</a> of China's tripartite Party-State-Military structure.</p>
<p>The government enacted tough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomic">macroeconomic</a> control measures to expunge low-tech, redundant projects and to avert violent market fluctuations. Attention was focused on strengthening agriculture and continuing a moderately tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>In March 1998, Jiang was re-elected President, while Li Peng was constitutionally required to step down from his post as Premier and replaced by Vice Premier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Rongji">Zhu Rongji</a>. Zhu was believed to be a tougher and more charismatic leader than Li Peng, whom many blamed for Tiananmen.</p>


<h2 class="page_title"><strong>Economic Development</strong></h2>
<p>While attempting to maintain political stability, Premier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Rongji">Zhu Rongji</a> kept things on track in the difficult years of the late 1990s, maintaining an average GDP growth of 9.7% a year over the two decades to 2000. Against the backdrop of the 1997 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_financial_crisis">Asian financial crisis</a> (precipitated when China devalued the RMB), the catastrophic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Yangtze_River_Floods">1998 Yangtze River Floods</a>, and a global economic slowdown, China's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> still grew by 7.9% in the first nine months of 2002. Active state intervention to stimulate demand through wage increases in the public sector and other measures showed the strength in the Chinese economic system in times of hardship.</p>
<p>As global firms scrambled to avoid missing the China boom, foreign direct investment (FDI) in China rose 22.6% in 2002 alone. While global trade grew by one percent in 2002, China's trade soared 18% in the first nine months of 2002, with exports outstripping imports.</p>
<p>Zhu also tackled deep-seated structural problems, such as uneven development divesting state-owned enterprises, resolving the triangular bad loan crisis and resolving questions over the pace of change.</p>
<p>The PRC leadership was also struggling to modernize and privatize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprises">State-owned enterprises</a> (SOEs) without inducing massive urban unemployment. The generation of people that, due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, lacked proper education or applicable skills found it increasingly difficult to find a stable place in the increasingly privatized workforce. Millions lost their jobs as state firms closed, so Zhu established financial safety nets for unemployed workers and new urban jobs to absorb laid off workers and rural migrants. Under the auspices of Zhu and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Jiabao">Wen Jiabao</a>, his top deputy and successor, the state has been alleviating unemployment while promoting efficiency by pumping tax revenues into the economy and expanding consumer demand.</p>
<p>Though critics charge that there is an oversupply of manufactured goods driving down prices and profits while increasing the level of bad debt in the banking system, demand for Chinese goods, domestically and abroad, is high enough to put those concerns to rest in the time being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhu's right-hand man, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Jiabao">Wen Jiabao</a>, oversaw regulations for the stock market and campaigned to develop poorer inland provinces to stem migration and regional resentment. Zhu and Wen also set tax ceilings for peasants to protect them from high levies by corrupt officials. Well respected by ordinary Chinese citizens, Zhu is also highly thought of by Western political and business leaders, who credit him with bringing China into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO). Wen replaced Zhu as Premier in March 2003. Like his fourth-generation colleague <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao">Hu Jintao</a>, Wen's personal opinions are difficult to discern since he sticks very closely to his script. While Zhu was frank and strong-willed, Wen is known for his suppleness and discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Crises abroad</strong></p>
<p>In May 1999, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> forces undergoing bombing operations in Yugoslavia during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War">Kosovo War</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade">bombed the Chinese embassy</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. The event resulted in the death of three Chinese journalists as well as a strong wave of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-American">anti-US</a> sentiment, supported by denunciations of the US in the Chinese media, who portrayed the attack as being on Chinese patriotism. Though the US declared the incident an accident, the Chinese government officially condemned the action and demanded a full apology. In an official statement, Vice-President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> condemned the action as "barbaric" and illustrative of "American hegemony."&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of the 21st century, China faced numerous challenges: China&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights">human</a> rights record has become the concern for many western governments, and US leaders seem required to mention the issue on every official state visit. Pro-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Independence">Taiwan Independence</a> forces of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party">Democratic Progressive Party</a> won the elections in Taiwan for the first time, derailing talks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_reunification">Chinese reunification</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Teng-hui">Li Teng-hui</a> published his "Two Countries Statement," labeling Taiwan an independent entity separate from China. Then, in April 2001, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Island_incident">a collision occurred</a> between a US spy-plane and a Chinese military jet near the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan">Hainan</a> strained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China-US_relations">China-US relations</a> even further.</p>
<p>Further, in July 2001, the PRC and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a> signed the twenty-year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Sino-Russian_Treaty_of_Friendship">Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation</a>, aimed at balancing out US dominance in global affairs.</p>
