    <p>Huangpu Park (黃浦公園) at the northern end of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund">the Bund</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> was established in 1886 to serve the growing number of foreigners living in Shanghai. The Public Garden was closed to Chinese people between 1890 and 1928 and, according to a popular myth, a sign at the park's gate read <em>No dogs or Chinese allowed</em>. However, there is no evidence that the sign ever existed in this form. In any case, the banning of Chinese from Huangpu Park and other parks in China has remained in the Chinese public consciousness as one of the many examples of the country's humiliation by the Western powers. A scene at Huangpu Park in the Bruce Lee film <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_Fury"><em>Fists of Fury</em></a> features a (fictitious) sign that reads: &ldquo;No dogs and Chinese allowed.&rdquo;</p>
