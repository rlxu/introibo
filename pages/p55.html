  <h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Long March</strong> <strong>紅軍長征</strong><strong> (1934-35)</strong></h2>
  <div class="text_body">
    <p>was a military retreat undertaken by the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Liberation_Army">Red Army</a> to evade the pursuit of the KMT army. Encircled by the KMT, the Communists, under the eventual command of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed some 8,000 miles over 370 days. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>.</p>
    <p>The Long March began <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>'s ascent to power, whose leadership during the retreat gained him the support of the members of the party. The bitter struggles of the Long March, which was completed by only about one-tenth of the force that left Jiangxi, would come to represent a significant episode in the history of the CCP, and would seal the personal prestige of Mao and his supporters as the new leaders of the party in the following decades.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Chiang's Encirclement Campaigns</strong></p>
    <p>In August 1934, with the Red Army depleted by prolonged conflict, a spy, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Xiong">Mo Xiong</a>, placed by Zhou Enlai in the KMT army headquarters in Nanchang brought news that Chiang Kai-shek was preparing a major offensive against the Communist capital, Ruijin. The Communist leadership decided on a strategic retreat to regroup with other Communist units, and to avoid annihilation.</p>
    <p><strong>Escape from Jiangxi</strong></p>
    <p>The withdrawal began in early October 1934. Zhou's intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang's blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Jitang">Chen Jitang</a>, a Guangdong warlord whom Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting. Zhou sent <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Hannian">Pan Hannian</a> to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting. The Red army successfully crossed the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinfeng_River">Xinfeng River</a> and marched through the province of Guangdong and into <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan">Hunan</a> before encountering the last of Chiang's fortifications at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_River">Xiang River</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Escaping Chiang's pursuit</strong></p>
    <p>When the army resumed its march northward, the direct route to Sichuan was blocked by Chiang's forces. Mao's forces spent the next several months maneuvering to avoid direct confrontation with hostile forces, but still attempting to move north to join <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Guotao">Zhang Guotao</a>'s Fourth Red Army. The Communist forces were harassed by both the KMT and its local <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_era">warlord allies</a>. To avoid a fatal confrontation with the enemy, Zhou and Mao maneuvered the Red army south and west, through Guizhou, Sichuan, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, feigning attacks on Guiyang and Kunming to disguise their movements. The Red Army had to cross mountains and rivers, often capturing river crossings heavily defended by hostile warlords and Nationalist troops, the most famous of which was <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luding_Bridge">Luding Bridge</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Reaching Yan'an</strong></p>
    <p>Mao's First Red Army traversed several swamps and was attacked by Muslim <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people">Hui</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Clique">Ma Clique</a> forces under Generals <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Bufang">Ma Bufang</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Buqing">Ma Buqing</a>. Finally, in October 1935, Mao's army reached Shaanxi province and joined with local Communist forces there, ending the Long March.</p>
    <p>All along the way, the Communist Army confiscated property and weapons from local <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord">warlords</a> and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor. Nevertheless, only some 8,000 troops under Mao's command, the First Front Army, ultimately made it to the final destination of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan%27an">Yan'an</a> in 1935. Of these, fewer than 7,000 were among the original 100,000 soldiers who had started the March. A variety of factors contributed to the losses including <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_%28physical%29">fatigue</a>, hunger and cold, sickness, desertion, and military casualties. During the retreat, membership in the party fell from 300,000 to around 40,000. In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.&nbsp;</p>
