  <h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Daoguang Emperor</strong><strong> 道光帝 </strong><strong>(ruled 1820 &ndash; 1850)</strong></h2>
  <div class="text_body">
    <p>was the second son of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor">Jiaqing Emperor</a>. His reign was marked by "external disaster and internal rebellion," that is, by the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>, and the beginning of numerous rebellions, which nearly brought down the dynasty.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Early years</strong></p>
    <p>Well liked by his grandfather <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qianlong</a>, he frequently accompanied the elderly emperor on hunting trips. On one such trip at the age of nine he killed a deer, much to the delight of Qianlong. Moreover, in 1813, he played a vital role in repelling <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus">White Lotus</a> invaders who had stormed the Forbidden City, and this heroic action helped secure his claim to the throne.</p>
    <p><strong>Reign as emperor and the opium trade</strong></p>
    <p>In 1820, at the age of 38, he inherited a declining empire with Westerners encroaching upon its borders. During his reign, China experienced major problems with <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a>, which was smuggled in by British merchants. Opium had started to trickle into China during the reign of Yongzheng, but was limited to approximately 200 chests annually. This amount increased to 40,000 chests during Daoguang's reign.</p>
