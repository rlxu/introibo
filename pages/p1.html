  <h2 class="page_title"><strong>The Macartney Embassy</strong></h2>
  <div class="text_body">
    <p>was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain">British</a> mission to China in 1793 led by the first envoy of Great Britain to China, Lord <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Macartney,_1st_Earl_Macartney">George Macartney</a>. The goal of the endeavor was to convince <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Qianlong">Emperor Qianlong</a> to allow Britain to have a permanent embassy in Beijing, and reduced tariffs on traders.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
    <p>Oceanic trade between China and Europe had begun in the sixteenth century, and over time included the Portuguese, the Spanish, the British, and the Dutch. To control and tax the foreigners, trade was eventually restricted to the port of Canton. Guidelines restricted formal trade to a handful of &ldquo;Hong&rdquo; (è¡Œ) merchants selected by the government. As trade intensified, disputes broke out between the British traders and the Hong. By the late 18th century, British traders were feeling confined by the system. They lobbied King George III to send an Embassy to go before the Emperor and request access to more ports and representation at Court. Lord George Macartney was sent for this reason.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The Tribute System</strong></p>
    <p>Foreign delegations seeking relations with China were required to present tribute, thereby acknowledging their inferior status, and to perform the kowtow. &nbsp;In return, the Emperor bestowed gifts and titles upon foreign emissaries and allowed them to trade for short periods of time during their stay within China.</p>
    <p>Foreign rulers agreed to these terms for several reasons; namely, because the gifts received from the Emperor were of greater value than the tribute given (as a demonstration of imperial munificence) and because the trade conducted while in China was extremely lucrative and exempt from customs duties. &nbsp;This arrangement became increasingly unacceptable to European nations, in particular to Great Britain.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>Since Macartney demanded that Britain be treated as an equal, he refused to kowtow, and the Embassy failed. Qianlong subsequently sent a letter to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_III">King George III</a>, explaining in greater depth the reasons for his refusal to grant the several requests presented by Macartney.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Qianlong&rsquo;s Response to George III</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>You, O King, live beyond the confines of many seas; nevertheless, impelled by your humble desire to partake of the benefits of our civilization, you have dispatched a mission respectfully bearing your memorial&hellip;</em></p>
    <p><em>As to your entreaty to send one of your nationals to be accredited to my Celestial Court and to be in control of your country's trade with China, this request is contrary to all usage of my dynasty and cannot possibly be entertained&hellip;</em></p>
    <p><em>As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Lord Macartney's Observations</strong></p>
    <p>In George Macartney's memoirs, there were many passages describing what was, in his opinion, an overall poor quality of life for the Chinese under Qing rule:</p>
    <p><em>The Empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a fortunate succession of vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these hundred and fifty years past, and to overawe their neighbours merely by her bulk and appearance. But whenever an insufficient man happens to have the command on deck, adieu to the discipline and safety of the ship. She may, perhaps, not sink outright; she may drift some time as a wreck, and will then be dashed to pieces on the shore; but she can never be rebuilt on the old bottom</em>.</p>
